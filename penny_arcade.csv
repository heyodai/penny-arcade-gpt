1,2003-01-01,Scott Kurtz,"
I got a lot of mail asking me to respond to Scott’s rant over at PvP. So I went over and read it this afternoon and I wasn’t really surprised. I am sure you are looking for me to do some kind of point counterpoint shit but that’s not going to happen. Instead of coming away from his rant upset I am mostly just disappointed. See we have had a sort of friendly rivalry with Scott for something like four years now.  We’ve chatted on the phone a few times and I met him in person once or twice. The thing that always stood out about Scott to me is just how much alike we are. You wouldn’t know it if you only read his comic strip but Scott is a son of a bitch just like me. We both enjoy saying things that piss people off. He cusses like a sailor and talks shit about everyone and their mother. And I think that is why we have always gotten along pretty well. What I never understood though is why we hardly ever see that side of Scott in his comic strips. I think that Kurtz is at his best when he is being satirical. His parodies of other webcomics are still some of the best work he has ever done. When Scott actually puts some of himself into his comics the stuff he comes up with is really special. I’m not saying I don’t like PvP, I think it’s generally a pretty good read. I enjoy the occasional fart joke just as much as the next guy, but It’s just that when I see a rant like this from Scott it reminds me what a fucking firebrand he really is. Sure I think everything he wrote is total bullshit but that doesn’t change the fact that I respect him for saying it. He knew it would piss people off, he said it anyway, and I’d bet dollars to doughnuts that son of a bitch cracks a little smile every time he gets another hate mail about it. Then I look at his comic strip and it just feels so watered down in comparison. I know you like to cuss Scott, I’ve heard you do it. Just write shit for God’s sake. I mean it’s not like we don’t know what S#!% is anyway. Just spell it the fuck out man. I know you have opinions. I’ve heard you say some stuff about Keenspot that is not only vicious as fuck but balls on accurate. Scott is probably the finest cartoonist in the medium of online cartoons right now. He can outdraw anyone else in the game. Many of you never saw the artwork he did on his other comic strip Wedlock but he had something fucking magical going on. All I’m saying is, why not put a little of that piss and vinegar you show in your rants and in real life into your comic strip. If he combined the razor sharp wit that I know he has with the raw artistic talent we’ve all seen the man would be unstoppable. Like Juggernaut, only he wouldn’t have a suit or anything. I mean he could get a suit but he wouldn’t really need it. It would just be like for show.

We only know two people who don't live within a half an hour of us, and with Kiko's arrival a couple days ago they've both been here in the last three weeks.  We have decided to celebrate this event as we celebrate all other things, which is to say, play videogames.  We also play videogames when we are not celebrating.  I'm not really unhappy with the system, I'm just making a note of it.


The only issue with our recent explicit revelry is that it has brought the ire of the apartment complex down upon us.  Their crimes are many, though, and they're hardly in a tenable position regarding infractions.  There's the lady right next door, who I think might just be a really big badger with a shirt on.  There is a sound from B-14 that could only be a large animal chewing a freshly fallen birch, which I feel lends credence to my badger hypothesis.  If the bitch wants to chew on some wood or be a badger or whatever that's fine, I can handle it.  But directly above us - and I mean right above us, suspended there - unholy acts are committed on a regular basis, and you don't see us running to the manager.  This guy is either killing a woman or engaging in some penultimate act of tantric erotica, and I honestly don't care which, but I do wish they would use their indoor voices!    


The thing is, we do honestly try to lay down some rules about noise at the beginning of each event, but it never pans out, because capturing the flag is like fireworks in your heart.  The trouble in this venue started with Soccer Slam, where it's like my mind knew that I could not explode with sound but as soon as we'd land a Killer Kick or a one-timer I'd be off the couch wagging the wavebird at the television in a derisive way.  We were only playing against the computer then, too - when the Halo gets in there, it's Living Room versus Computer Room, that ancient and bitter rivalry born with the very firmament.


Also, hopefully you've seen it already:  the trailer for Quentin Tarantino's (Spell checker suggestion:  ""Tarantula's"") newest movie is now awailable.  I didn't know what to think at first, but the second time I watched it I felt joy.  I've always really liked his dialogue, that's why I see his movies, and there isn't a whole lot of that to judge here.

I talked to the lady from Entertainment Weekly again and this time I didn’t hang up on her. She says the article on PA should appear in the issue that hits stands next Friday. That’s one week from today. I don’t know how robust it will be but some people asked about it so I thought I would share the info I had. 


Kiko, Monkey, Tycho and I just spent about three hours playing Guilty Gear XX. Some really weird shit gets said during these matches that you just don’t hear in other fighters. Stuff like, “Fuck your teddy bear!” or “No not the swimming!” It has the strangest bunch of characters I’ve seen in a fighter since Jo Jo’s Bizarre adventure. I think this is the game that will get Tycho back into fighters. When I saw him bring up Gamefaqs to find some combos I had to choke back some tears.

4,2003-01-06,Penny Arcade is A Comedy Bistro,"
Over at Gabe's yesterday, I mentioned that Guilty Gear XX was one of the most complete, satisfying experiences in any genre.  Thinking back on it, that may have been hyperbole.  I was drunk with victory at the time I said it, so that might be connected.    


As posted yesterday, the last fighting game I took at all seriously was Tekken 3, and I could break a man with Jin Kazama using very little effort.  After thinking about why that might have been the case, it became fairly obvious why.  There's more than one reason, but here's the first of the two: I had a condition that I call ""Fighter Fatigue.""  We played every fighter the day it came out in arcade or otherwise, and we played them like we meant it.  Eventually all fighters seemed perfectly alike.  Being no stranger to the genre, I knew that on some level they probably did different things, but I didn't really care to find out.  The primary author of my new apathy was Capcom, and though I have almost limitless respect for the venerable development house, motherfuckers know how to work a franchise.                  


Virtua Fighter 4 was almost enough to bust me out of it.  What could accurately be called a martial arts simulator, the VF series is one I never really got into because it was like a dollar a play.  It costs less to play longer in Vegas.  I felt the old motions and savvy returning.  Mortal Kombat V is also pretty fun, but I was primed by VF4, so it hit twice as hard.  I was now in scoring position for the next excellent fighter, and lo and behold, what should come along but Guilty Gear double X.   


Jesus Christ.


I wouldn't even touch the controller to begin with, that's how much I wasn't going to play.  The game that brought me back into the fray needed to disarm the numbness I felt about fighters in general - and the way it did it was with unbelievable, original character designs.  Gabe had gotten into the first one pretty seriously, and while I could appreciate it then I wasn't ready for the genre yet.  Now I'm completely psychotic about it.  Looking around the web, you can see that the gameplay of Guilty Gear is a matter of some contention.  I'm completely mystified by this.  We're talking about a fighter that is as deep as you want it to be, and I guarantee there is a character in that massive roster that is perfect for every player.  Eighty percent of all fights over here end as virtual ties, with devastating upsets practically every other round.  You get out of it what you put into it, I guess.  


What I get out of it is victory.  Utilizing Eddie's rich arsenal to the fullest, I was able to claim victory over Gabe favorite Chipp Zanuff.  Of course he can't just admit that, he has to blame sunspots or some shit.  The excuses are easy to categorize.      


Probably True:  ""I have a blister on my thumb.""


Unlikely:  ""I spilled Sprite on my controller a few days ago, and now the x button sticks.""


Highly Specious:  ""My alien physiology makes it difficult to grasp human controllers.""

I thought that I had uploaded the comic, but I also thought I was a ninja for a time, which culminated in a grievous leg injury.  The strip is up now, for reals this time.


And yes, I am aware that the lighting solution on the new Gameboy Advance SP is technically a frontlight, not unlike Triton Labs' Afterburner product.  I am very curious to see how Nintendo's solution compares to the unofficial add-in.  Very curious indeed.     


Dropping here on March 23rd, this new Gameboy will arrive just shy of two years after its predecessor.  I want to be angry about that, but I can't, because it's platinum.  Have you seen it?  I just want to snatch it up in my talons and try to incorporate it into my nest somehow.  I guess I'd be angrier if it made deeper changes to the system, necessitating an upgrade for all portable gamers - but the fact is that no upgrade is really required, especially if you've gone to the trouble if installing a lighting system or tacked on one of those FloodLights.  I would call myself very interested in it, because I like to adopt things, and when I adopt them I like to adopt them early.  The rechargeable battery pack is something we should have seen a long time ago.  If I get my hands on it, though, and it doesn't measure up?  I don't feel like Nintendo has me between a rock and a hard place.  In fact, I feel like they're the ones that are kind of tense.  Cell phones and cell manufacturers are trying to eat their lunch with simple, portable games that ride on devices people already carry around with them.           


I appear to have gotten onto some new PR list at Microsoft, because Freelancer and Impossible Creatures showed up a few days ago completely uninvited but not necessarily unwelcome.  Let's talk about them in reverse alphabetical order.


Impossible Creatures does absolutely nothing for me.  I did not enjoy typing that sentence, because I have massive loyalty to Relic and I honestly love the central concept.  I'm sure you've heard of it, this is the one where you mix the animals up and I really like that part - I just don't like the game that is built up around it very much.  The demo they released would never install right on my system, so maybe this is all old news to other people.  As is my way, I will play it for a period of an hour and a half uninterrupted before I uninstall it.  If my feeling on the matter changes - and this forced period often does reveal value - then I will let you know.  


Freelancer is actually kind of weird.


You may recall that we saw the game a few years ago, two or three, Jesus, I don't remember, at an E3 showing.  Things were a bit different then, and it would be underestimating my reaction to say that I thought it was vile.  What had always been discussed as a sort of unofficial sequel to the Privateer franchise had become this Space Flight 101 mockery.  A space game without a flight yoke seemed to me like no space game at all.  I know many people have been playing them for years with mice, and had success, but that doesn't make a lick of difference to me.  You would literally click on a guy, your ship would follow him automatically, and then you would click on him until he had died.  Freelancer has been in the wings for a while, and I'd long assumed that it had been shelved or something - but I think the main issue is that developer Digital Anvil went through a period of very rough water.  What I'm playing here is apparently some kind of press beta, so maybe there are still some changes to be made - but the game that is on the CD, as it stands, right now, is actually pretty cool.  There's no flightstick option that I can see, but the Auto-Following stuff is gone, which goes a long way toward giving the game back to the player.  What didn't come across at that showing we saw at the E3 is that the game is actually a sort of RPG.  I know, I know.  But it's true.  You gain levels, levels give you access to finer technology, you take missions and gain experience.  With the controls being what they are, the playing of it actually feels like a Space Adventure instead of a Sim, which I was too angry/righteous/fancy to see before.  The cut scenes are ofttimes strange and stilted, and I don't particularly look forward to them.  On the other hand, the combat, missions, exploration, and variety could easily be designated as a Superfun site.  Oh yeah, and it also has full multiplayer in a dynamic galaxy, just like they always hoped.  I can't find anybody online to test it out with, though.

7,2003-01-11,Tao Feng,"
Tycho and I were invited out to see some new games over at Microsoft today. I live like fifteen minutes from them so it's not like they had to fly our asses out or anything. Tycho said we were going to see Brute Force and get a free lunch so I was super excited. When we got there they told us we were going to see Tao Feng and get a free lunch. I am not sure if Tycho knew this all along or not but I would not be surprised. Anyway the free lunch was still a reality so I decided to stick around. I am pretty glad I did too because Tao Feng ended up being pretty cool. I am getting ahead of myself though. Let me tell you what it's like when you go to one of these things.


You always read about people who get to go preview games but until today we had never actually done it. I don't really think of Tycho and I as journalists so that never really bothered me though. During lunch one of our hosts asked us how long we had been in the industry. Until that moment we actually had not realized that we were in the industry. In fact I still don't think we are. These PR types seem to think we are though, and if that means they show us early builds of their games then they are welcome to continue doing so. 


After our lunch they took us to a little meeting room with a fancy TV and a decent surround sound set up. While they were talking about something I was sort of scoping out the room and I noticed a large white board to my left. As I inspected it further I realized that it had on it the release dates by month for Xbox games.  Just as it registered that I was probably looking at something I shouldn't be I was interrupted. They leapt in front of the board and began erasing like mad. They even erased the little note that said in all capital letters ""DO NOT ERASE!"" Tycho and I found this part especially funny. Cameron who is like the head PR guy for Tao Feng quickly directed our attention to his game which he now had up and running on the television. 


So the game is set in present time in an alternate reality where I guess China colonized North America first. Or something. Cameron said they hired a professional writer to make the story. They said the same thing about Doom 3 and Tycho and I think it's fucking hilarious. Do they not understand that even if they hired someone who had never written anything before to write the story that the very act of hiring them would indeed make them a professional writer. I am sure this lady is a super good writer but it still cracks me up. Anyway, professional writers aside the game looks really good. And it damn well should, Craig Mullins is the man doing the concept artwork for the game. You are no doubt familiar with his work although you may not know it. He's done concept art and Matte Paintings for all kinds of movies and shit. The guy is fucking amazing and if you don't go check out his site then you're a bad person. 


Beyond the slick visuals the game actually plays really well too. John Tobias co-creator of Mortal Kombat no doubt has a lot to do with that. The game actually feels a lot like a Mortal Kombat game, although more brutal if that's possible. One of the really cool features of TF is that the characters take damge and it affects their performance. Break a guys arm or beat on it enough and eventually it's going to be all but useless. Fighters build up ""Chi"" which they can use to do special moves or heal broken limbs. As fights progress characters get bruised, cut and dirty. It's actually a really nice effect and  one that sort of makes TF stand out from other fighters. Another cool feature is the interactive environments. You can kick off walls, swing around poles and break all kinds of shit. One level had us fighting in an arcade and you could knock your opponent into the machines and they would bust apart. In fact knocking your opponent into a wall or box or whatever will actually increase the amount of damage they take. I like that.


They told us that we were supposed to play with this one character because he was the only one that had really been tuned. The other ones I guess were not quite done yet. Obviously we paid no attention to this and proceed to check out all the characters in the game and all the environments. I mean they bought us lunch so the way I see it they sort of owed us. All your basic fighting game characters are there. You've got bouncy chicks, old men, kung fu studs, the big slow guy and the weirdo. It could be that my standards for character design have been unfairly raised by Guilty Gear XX but none of these people really did anything special for me. I will say that Master Sage the old Chinese man was pretty slick but compared to other old Chinese guys like Shun from Virtua Fighter or my personal favorite Wang from Tekken he doesn't really bring anything new to the table. I will say that the character designs are some of the best I have seen from a 3D fighter that isn't Tekken, Virtua Fighter or Soul Calibur. In fact just a few weeks ago Tycho and I had a conversation where we wondered why anyone who isn't Namco or Sega even bothers making 3D fighters. I mean even Capcom, a company that knows how to make a goddamned fighting game hasn't been able to pull off a 3D fighter that is able to go toe to toe with Tekken or VF. The fact that the guys at Gigante are even trying to make a 3D brawler is admirable. The fact that they have succeeded in making one that doesn't suck ass is down right miraculous. 


What we saw of the game was pretty early I guess and a lot of the characters that we weren't supposed to play with but did anyway weren't quite done. Even with all that I still found the game to be enjoyable. I think it's got potential and I'm really curious to see what they end up with. 


Then they brought out Kung Fu Chaos which is one of the best games I have ever played. I'll let Tycho tell you about that one though.

This newspost delay was brought to you by AT&T's sterling Cable Internet service.


We were not especially struck by any of the news out there, at least, not in a comic way, so we took advantage of that fact and decided to do whatever we wanted.  Technically we do whatever we want whether or not we have an excuse to, but it rarely reaches this threshold of elaboration when we're just messing around.  Also, apparently the Japanese stuff at the top actually says what it is supposed to - so obviously, we had nothing to do with it.  The strange characters that make up Japanese fill me with a vague unease.  No, that's all Kiko, who apparently has some faculty with it.  And he's not Japanese, either, that's the thing.  In fact, if there is a name less Japanese than Francisco Villasenor I would be surprised to see it.


One piece of news did have a certain flavor, but at this point we were already done with the comic so it didn't have a chance to germinate.  Courtesy of The Magicbox (compulsory daily reading) we have shots of the console specific characters for each version of Soul Calibur II.  If you didn't already know, just go look and be overcome with emotion.  By all available information, it sounds like we're in for the same luxurious treatment Namco has always given home conversions of this series.  Soul Calibur for the DC remains a top contender in virtually every scoreable category, even categories you make up on the spot, like ""Best, uh... Spelunking.""  The only thing you could fault it for, really, was that it did not include the exhilarating weapon collection of its prior iteration - and it's back for Soul Calibur II.  Come to think of it, I've never even seen Soul Calibur II at a Seattle arcade, or anywhere else for that matter, so it seems likely that my first experience will be with the lavish home version on the console of my choice.    


I started using ICQ again for some reason, I hadn't used it in maybe two years, and all these people I used to talk to apparently never pruned me from their lists.  It's like opening a time capsule every time I connect to it, I don't know who half these people are, and I don't have the logs from back then but apparently I logged off in the middle of a conversation.  I was talking to Soup last night, I guess he's made a dark pact with continuity of all things.  People change, you know?  I had a friend back in the day named Brad who ran a humor site called Lowpass.net, he was written up in Wired for promoting it via spoofed Eminem tracks.  It turns out he's still alive, and when he's not maintaining his sites Strip Creator or In4mador he puts out some really catchy songs.  You see, he's kind of a renaissance dork.   


I wanted to thank Nexon for sponsoring Penny Arcade this month, they just moved from the front page to the strip page.  Shattered Galaxy 1.5 has a really interesting take on Real-Time Strategy, and it's been doing things since version 1.0 that other games in the genre would do well to learn from.  It has a free trial, and it only costs ten bucks to upgrade the demo to retail status if you find yourself hooked.  Give it a try, see if it does it for you.

I'm not sure if you've had a chance to check out Panzer Dragoon Orta yet, as it did only hit this Wednesday.  Good god.  Now, before I launch into full scale hyperbole about the game's divine heritage, we did make a comic about it that I found very amusing.


Because I have a very poor memory, it is often the case that I will be happy without knowing why.  This has happened with games prior to Panzer Dragoon Orta, which is a name I have already begun to tire of typing, so let's go with Panzer or Orta or PDO or something from now on.        


So I woke up yesterday and even droll hues seemed lively.  My English muffin was more English, yet at the same time muffiner.  I noticed my SimCity 4 manual, and though it too made a sound like music that wasn't it.  No, it was something with Dragons.       


I recall that Official Xbox Magazine - in a coverdisc they will never top again - put out their December issue with Splinter Cell and Panzer right on there.  I also remember that, while I liked Orta very much, it was not terribly difficult or scary unless you were a perhaps an adorable kitten and not a seasoned gamer.  Well, those days are over.  It may invigorate you when I say that they have jacked up the difficulty, jacked it up, sir, bring a teddy bear because you will require immediate comfort after each level.  PDO really seems like a nod to the shooter proponent, the old school, and it has the feel of a loving pet project.  It is also an unforgiving pain matron who delights in your misery!     


It's actually very nice to fall back into a fairly pure shoot-'em-up without stealth elements or squad-based tactics.  The game is like a vacation from complexity.  I'm not even saying complexity is bad, what I mean is that I think it is a development fad right now.  You can agree or not agree with that, I don't have any intention of keeping track.  There is also some discussion about whether or not the game has enough replay value, being a scant two hours in length.  For the record, I've played it for three hours, and I haven't even beaten it yet.  But shooters as a genre have always defied a mechanical formula of determining play time - ""One can complete all objectives and defeat the final boss within X hours.""  If you rent it and see it as a sort of two-hour tour through the luscious and surreal world they've created, you'll probably enjoy that very much.  But for someone who is into shooters, it's never A to B objective stuff.  It's, can I destroy every fighter of every wave in this level?  Can I get every power-up?  Success and even the game parameters are more personal, self-directed, to the genre advocate.        


Since reading Neuromancer at age twelve, William Gibson has always occupied a somewhat celestial position for me.  Two stars made up his glasses and another fifty-six made up his apocryphal typewriter.  The only reason I even knew there was a William Gibson in the first place was the game based on his work, so I guess that's one more thing to thank videogames for.  In any event, when looking for information about his new book Pattern Recognition, I stumbled upon what was apparently his personal site, with a tantalizing ""Blog"" link that was bereft of content at the moment.  Lo and behold, what should I notice over at the mysterious and sensual Emma's but a notice that Mr. Gibson had begun blogging in earnest.  A thousand joys!

It is true enough that SimCity 4 inspired the strip in question, but it order to speak with any clarity on the subject I think I would have to be better at the game.  I am remarkable as a mayor only insofar as I have left the most ruined lives in my wake.  When things start to go south for my town, I go south, literally, far enough south that no-one has ever heard my name or anything about the failed missile tests in Sailbourne.  Also, if anyone asks about the meltdown in Beringer I cock my head and look confused, as though I have only peripheral knowledge of language.  Reviews of the game have, thus far, been very favorable on the whole, so if you have any interest whatsoever in the design and maintenance of urban spaces you have probably met your match.  Two items come to mind.

Perhaps it is because I started this series with another person present, but I have never enjoyed playing these games alone as much as I enjoyed playing them with someone else.  The fundamentals are all there, and obviously the game is the same whether I have one, two, or five hundred chairs set in front of the machine.  Sim games are, by design I'm sure, comprised of a dense, perhaps coded sequence of victories and defeats.  Having another mind present lends itself to a sort of celebratory atmosphere where successes are amplified, while multiple perspectives on a given issue help resolve crises as they arise.
I forgot the other thing.  No, I've got it now.  Where is the Goddamn multiplayer?  I didn't expect it, I don't necessarily need it, but if you say I have it and then I go to play it and I get this:

""Soon you'll be able to get access to the new SimCityscape feature which will let you take your game to a new level! It's not quite ready yet, as we're still putting the finishing touches on it, but check back soon!""


Soon, huh?  With an exclamation point?  Now I'm twice as excited!!!!!!!


That's, uh, unacceptable.  You already missed a Christmas launch, guys.  You could have kept the game in the oven for another month and you wouldn't have heard boo out of me.  Now, who knows?  You might hear boo.  All I want from you people is for the things in the manual to actually be in the game.  This isn't me being some weirdo fuckhead out on some crazy website.

We didn't know what to make of Infinium Labs' mysterious ""Phantom"" gaming console, but I'm reasonably sure we have accurately portrayed its origins.  Every new console has to go through this hazing procedure from us, even magical, spectral consoles like the Phantom which are made of ectoplasm.  Feel free to examine their site for clues on what exactly they're doing.   IGN pondered many of the same questions we did, it would appear.  It seems like it's essentially a sealed PC with a broadband service component that delivers retail games.  I mean, don't quote me on that.  They could be selling goats for all I know.  


Does everyone name their first SimCity Funkytown?  I have a suspicion that this is true.  What if you run that city into the ground, creating a hell on Earth that subverts God's divine plan?  When you wipe that town, do you name the new one New Funkytown?  I'm just wondering how common this is.   


To be honest, at the moment I'm sort of afraid to invest myself in another town.  Monkey and I had what we thought was a very nice town going, New Funkytown.  It was the sort of town one exhorts others to take them to.  We had some horses, some toxic chemical plants, in essence everything that makes America great.  After we'd been playing for a couple hours and really become invested in the welfare of those friendly horses the game crashed to desktop.  Now, this is a very different matter from the ""bluescreen/restarts your computer"" bug.  If you've been having that, it's because (as Safety Monkey sussed out after hours of trial and error) the game simply does not like Anti-Aliasing, no way no sir, so if you're having trouble running the game at all look to your advanced video card settings and see if you might have left it on.  When a game crashes to desktop with no error, though, no apparent reason, it gives one the impression that it could happen at any Goddamn time.  As often as not, under these circumstances I wait until a patch is released before playing it again, because I really don't want to hate my games.  A tiny bird told me that the ""Bonus Transportation CD"" I got when I bought the game can cause crashes under certain circumstances, maybe that's it, but when something says Bonus on it (Goddammit) that's supposed to mean something good.  I uninstalled and reinstalled just the game, I will tell you how it goes. 


Also:  I don't know if you have played the Joe Millionaire drinking game - obviously, if you aren't this tall, you can't ride this ride.  There are so many drink triggers in this show that the human mind could never unravel them all.  As soon as the show comes on, just start drinking until the show is over.  This is a game you can play with any show.

I don’t generally read other web comics. I mean I read PvP but that's about it. Today I got sidetracked though and ended up looking at about five or six different strips and I came to a conclusion... I don’t bitch nearly enough about how hard it is to make a comic strip.


I get mail all the time asking me for advice on how to start a web comic and I usually say the same thing to everyone. It's the same advice that I got from another artist when I was just a kid. “Draw every single day and when you get work, never miss a deadline.” In my opinion you either love to draw or you don’t. I always find it a bit strange when I see people (especially the ones that do this full time) bitching about what a hard job they have. I will admit that this can be a tough job sometimes. It certainly isn’t for people who like a steady income or job security. But it still doesn’t get any better than drawing for a living. 


So here is my advice to anyone starting a comic strip. First off, do it because you love it and because you feel like if you don’t get all the ideas in your head out on paper you might just explode. Second, make comic strips that YOU like and that YOU think are funny. Don’t listen to anyone else, remember you are doing this for yourself not them. Third, if you make a schedule like three times a week or, God help you daily you stick to it.  The best way to keep people coming back to your site is to update when you say you will without fail. You start missing days and people will stop coming, I guarentee . Don’t feel like you have to do a daily strip either. We aren’t all cartooning robots like Kurtz. If all you can do is three a week, then do three a week but don’t miss a beat. Last but not least, no one wants to here you bitch and moan about how your dogs kept you up last night so you didn’t have time to draw strip. This is either something you can do or it’s not. I swear to God sometimes I think Piro is about three sad girl drawings away from a complete breakdown. 


Anyway, that’s my advice. Take it for what you will. I’m not saying I have all the answers or even that there are answers when it comes to web comics and art but if this is really what you want do, then I think you could do a lot worse than following some of those tips.

With humans in a mad rush to snap up movie licenses (an in some cases molest them), the acquisition of the Metroid movie rights seems like it could be a cause for celebration or alarm.  As it happens, there's another license out there now that we think could be a real blockbuster.  Get it?  Blockbuster.


I got The Getaway, and it's okay.  I keep playing it because I'm curious about the story and I like the accents, not because it screams ""I am a good game and must be played.""  I knew I would feel like this even before I bought it, in fact I think I said as much, so I should probably just admit I was right and take it back in.  I didn't bite on DOA: Extreme Beach Something, I think because I was already getting The Getaway when I knew I shouldn't have, but I don't doubt that it will be fine for what it is.  It's a toy where you earn money, via volleyball and otherwise, and then you buy more swimsuits for the laydays.  I am sure it is the best game of it's kind.  I just don't have room for it at the moment.


I'll tell you what, though.  Have you played this War Of The Monsters game?  The irascible Batjew brought this over last night and it's a Goddamn gem.  Here's the issue.  This game needs a) four player support, and b) online support like nobody's business.  Let's rewind for a second, though.  This is a PS2 game that looks good, and I don't mean ""looks good for a PS2 game.""  I mean it looks good in a completely unqualified way.  The presentation be hot, replete with Drive-In, Creature Feature shtick.  If the game had one of the features I mentioned, online or Quad-Tap, I honestly believe this is the kind of game people would dig out the PS2 for in a few years, and be like, ""You never played War of the Monsters, Bob?  You never played War of the Fucking Monsters?  We need to fix that shit right now,"" so on and so forth.  Two player is still, in my opinion, awesome.  All we're talking about here is the difference between awesome and classic.


So, do I need a whole gig?  Why, yes.  Yes I do.

Here's the strip.  I'll get to it in a second.


The only good thing about driving somewhere is Depeche Mode's album Violator, and I'm willing to be fairly firm on this point.  The place we were going to go was not two hours away, as had been claimed, but rather five hours, according to cartographers, but what would they know about land, elevation, and distance.  


I sent Gabe a quick email yesterday from this place of abject despair.  Would I survive?  And who would care?  My corpse would feed the spooky, bare apple trees of the Methow Valley, permeated by packets of wireless data.  Arguably, more people would eat apples than read this site, so if I want my byproducts to reach the largest audience I should have dug a hole right there and just laid down in it.  These are the thoughts that occur to a person who has made their peace with eternity.    


I had brought along my Sidekick, which I am never without, in the hopes that I would be suspended in precious signal long enough each day to keep up with your world.  I have been meaning to extol the device in a post, as the device is a super big deal to me whenever I can get it away from Brenna.  However, it has become readily apparent to me that we are no longer allowed to like or enjoy things, because liking or enjoying things is evidence of collusion between ourselves and gigantic corporate identities.  I have absolutely zero inclination to engage in your part-time, pop nihilism.  Yes, yes, everything is quite droll and tiresome.  Nothing is worthy.  Everyone is a hypocrite and so forth.  Your parents don't understand you.  Get your account at the Something Awful forums, provided they don't just come free when you turn thirteen.     

In any event, my trip was essentially a point to point journey though every part of this state that has no cell access.  It was as though I was travelling straight down through the strata of the Earth, a sort of low-tech time travel.  I can tell you this much, the farther away you get from population centers - from civilization - the better the pie.  This pie was, I mean, it was what every pie longs, strains to become.  It represented the potential inherent in each pie.  It was superior in every way to oral sex.  I have been married for a while, so perhaps I should say it is better than the memory of oral sex.  I seem to recall it being pretty not so bad.


Oh yeah, Ain't It Cool Games.  I don't really care one way or the other.

20,2003-01-29,Discontent,"
I just jumped on Mechassault to see if they had made liars out of us, but no, it's still true: the promised content for January is still missing.  This is an example of a topic I want to be wrong on, and the moment I become wrong I'll mention it here.     


On a whim, I called the Software Etc. in Bellevue to see if they had Devil May Cry 2 in stock.  When she said yes, it came as sort of a shock so I just said ""Okay,"" in a quiet voice and hung up.  Gabriel, enraged, asked why I hadn't reserved any copies.  I called again and asked to reserve the copies, but then I hung up again before I said who I was, so I had to call back.  We got the game home without incident.


So far I'm really enjoying it.  Sort of surprised to find that it was two discs, but I don't know that each one is completely full - you simply put in the disk for whatever character you want to play as.  In Gabe's case the discs were reversed, so we spent an hour or so waiting to play as Dante when we could have just swapped him in.  It's not that the other character (""Lucia"") isn't good, and play-wise they're nearly identical before upgrades.  It's the pistols we want.  What I'm looking for in a game is to shoot magic guns at two monsters while wearing a really striking coat.   


Here are the things I don't particularly like.  The camera gets really wonky more often than I want it to, routinely obscuring important shit, and while it keeps up with the protagonist quite well it seldom paints a truly useful scene when surrounded by enemies.  I don't like that, but it's no dealbreaker.  Most of the enemies are dispatched via a lock-on system, so getting a bead even on things you can't see isn't that tough.  The other thing, maybe it's conscious on their part, maybe it isn't, is that Dante's devil blood made him kind of a smart-ass the first time around and you don't see much of that here.  There were bosses that he had a sort of relationship with during the course of the game, which made for some interesting dialogue opportunities.  Dramatic speeches have, thus far, been fairly sparse.  Capcom dialogue has sometimes been unintentionally amusing, but that has always been part of the charm.  It is very fun as straight blaster, but they're either changing up the formula here or forgetting they made the first game, and I can't tell which.  


I'm not sure if you've seen the Coke commercial where there is a girl singing about how they should make an effort to keep things ""really real,"" or something, in any event her commitment to reality is considerable.  Then a rap guy busts out with some Philosophy 101 type shit about disparate interpretations of the real, based on a source reality we will call R.  This commercial, and indeed many commercials, give me the sensation that I am losing my mind.  I feel like the very act of watching them erodes my humanity.  Though, it is nice to know that ""real"" is now a code-word for facsimile.  I guess what I'm getting at is that I have a Tivo now, and if I never see another Goddamn Coke commercial it will be too soon.

Thank you very much for all the great feedback on the Dante Pic. I got the same questions a lot so I am just gonna answer them here. 


The sketch was done once again on my tablet PC in Sketchbook. You can see the uncolored sketch here.


I colored it in Photoshop 6.0. No special tricks or anything. I set the sketch layer to ""multiply"" which allows me to color on a layer under the sketch and have it show through. 


I also got a lot of mail from artists asking for tips and advice. I will be honest with you, I don't feel like I am at a point in my life as an artist where I can dish out my own little pearls of wisdom. What I can do though is tell you a story.


When I was a junior in High School Mark Kistler came to visit the elementary school where my mom worked. I had grown up watching his television show and so I went down there to meet him. I took along my portfolio, which at that time pretty much consisted of shitty drawings of Wolverine. I got the chance to talk to him and show him my stuff, which he actually liked. He offered me a job working on his next book. It was my job to ink all of his pencil drawings for his book ""The Imagination Station"". Feel free to check the credits next time your in a book store for my name. Anyway, the inking was time consuming, tedious and boring work but the way I saw it I was breaking into the industry. I wasn't exactly sure which industry but I was breaking into it by god.  After about a year of inking he rewarded me with the opportunity to do the cover art. Not a bad pay off the way I saw it. After everything was all finished and the book went off to print he paid me what I now know was fucking didly squat for the amount of work I did and gave me this advice: ""Draw every day, no matter what."" For some reason those words stuck with me. 


If you take time every single day to draw you cannot help but improve. Just take a sketchbook with you to school and draw the kids in your class. Or take one into meetings with you, the boss will think your taking notes. If you can just draw something everyday you will be surprised how much and how fast you improve. Just as a point of reference I dug out the very first piece of Gabeart I ever did. It's Jin from Tekken and I did it four years ago. God this is embarrassing. 


Oh and one thing they don't show in Mark Kistlers drawing for kids videos is that the man smokes like a fucking chimney. I am serious. The first time I saw him I thought he was on fire.

The guns are actually called that.  So is the song.  


It is perhaps my life's greatest sadness to announce that the bad reviews of Devil May Cry 2 are right on the money.  Where the reviewers and I might differ somewhat is in their extremely high opinion of the first game. 


The complicated thing is that I still think that Devil My Cry 2 is fun, it's fun to shoot the guys, and if fun is the only axis we're analyzing then it does okay.  Dante - already a very stylish character - has been given some schmancy new maneuvers that, while not always useful, are always appealing.  So style, at least where characters are concerned, we've got that too.  Already it sounds like I'm talking about a Woo flick.  There are just so many missed opportunities in virtually every other department that it would be impossible to recommend it straight across without about fifteen minutes of qualifications.    


Though in my opinion (this is from the archive, actually) the first Devil May Cry ""loses cohesion"" an hour from the end of the game, Devil May Cry 2 has never even heard of cohesion.  ""What's that?"" it will ask you, with a quizzical look.  ""Well, Devil May Cry 2,"" you will say with some exasperation, ""Cohesion is when the things that happen in the game, I mean, in you, seem to fit together sensibly and bolster the entire concept.""  


""Oh,"" it will say.  


While the savvy action portions of the game have migrated from the first with only a few additions, storywise the game is completely MIA.  It's not that boring things are always happening (although I guess that is up to interpretation), it's that nothing really happens, ever - nothing you don't expect, anyhow.  I was titillated by the idea of Dante doing his thing in dystopian (spell checker suggestion: ""Dyspepsia""), urban environments, at least until I saw them.  It strikes me that I wrote papers like them in elementary school:  rote, repetitive, meandering excesses that did not utilize higher brain functions, for myself or for the reader.  Don't even start me on the fucking camera in this game.  I want to stress that, even as I am typing these things, these terrible things, I do sort of have the urge to hit some demons up in the air with my sword.  That's the grim duality of the game, it has these cool characters with spectacular abilities in stupid places doing things I don't care about.  Whatever I might think about the conclusion of the original Devil May Cry, a lot of very cool things happened.  It had really interesting gothic sensibilities, a healthy dose of strange melodrama,  extremely hot arachnids, and so forth.  When I say that something is missing from the one I'm playing now, it is as though I have the version without cutscenes.  It is that jarring.          


Like any good action movie, DMC2 does sport a few clever set pieces that you will appreciate.  I doubt that they will overshadow the rest of it for you.  I hope that the third time will be the charm, then again, I hoped the second time would be the charm.

23,2003-02-01,Unsubstantiated Rumors,"In his latest article Storm Shadow gave us the low down on his recent trip to CES. One of the items he mentioned in passing in that article was a possible new price and design for the Xbox. Here is the excerpt from his article:

Xbox is also rumored to be under a design change, to a smaller package with the same capabilities. Microsoft plans on bringing the price to $99 US. This is also a clue that they will make consoles a subscription product soon, which I pretty much hate the idea of. The only things I like subscribing to are Maxim Magazine and a high opinion of myself. You see, to bankers everywhere, the words ""reoccurring revenue stream"" sound just like ""Anna Kournikova naked""… 



Since Stormy delivered this article I have talked to a few other people in the know who have confirmed this scenario.  If I was a betting man I'd put money on a new smaller sleeker Xbox by next Christmas along with a new $99 price point.  The catch of course being that you will need to sign up for a few years of Xbox Live along with it. 


I don't really see this rumor getting much play at any of the other news sites so I figured I'd mention it here. Since I see Xbox live as being an integral part of owning an Xbox it seems to me like it's probably a pretty good deal. I mean, as far as I'm concerned you are gonna need to have Live anyway, so why not get your box for $99. It will be interesting to see if this turns out to be true and if so what kind of reaction it gets.

All I'm saying is that it is time for a new Sonic game, and I don't mean new to the GameCube.  Rumors said the new one might not be a remake, and wouldn't that have been nice! 


I read an article on Eurogamer that was not correct I believe, factually speaking.  I'm not doing this to be contentious, it's just that the thing they got wrong is the thing I think is most interesting about the game.  


We're seeing more ways to set yourself apart as a commander these days in real-time strategy.  You have always been able to construct strike groups out of the units of your choice, but what I'm talking about in this case is ways to personalize your forces and your abilities.  Impossible Creatures lets you build entire units to a custom spec and field them.  Age of Mythology lets you choose which Gods your society reveres most, revealing or closing off different technologies in mid-game.  Warcraft 3 has the leveling/RPG thing as relates to hero units.  Generals has a couple different ways of differentiating players from its three armies, the most basic way being genuinely interesting modifications to units.  There is a massive Chinese tank, for example, that is already dangerous because it is bristling with huge guns of varying types.  There is (as I understand it) a ""Propaganda"" upgrade for the vehicle that places loudspeakers on the back, blaring hateful rhetoric that emboldens nearby soldiers.  My experience with the game pointed out several such additions to units which really gave me the sense of altering a total ""battlefield ecology,"" which is something I discussed before during my Red Alert 2 period.  Generals is by the much same team as I understand it, not Westwood proper (RIP), so that would make sense.  This isn't the part the Eurogamer article got wrong, that's coming up in the next paragraph.        


I was wowed by the game at E3, as any person in command of their faculties must necessarily have been.  It was then that I learned that each of the three sides had a general you could choose, and these ""Generals"" could determine your aptitudes and a portion of your tech tree.  I thought that was mighty fine, but apparently they themselves did not, because the most recent version of the game I have played does not have a feature like that.  The way it works now can best be described by comparing it to Warcraft 3.  In Warcraft 3, you create an altar, and then you create a hero, and then your hero goes out and kills stuff and levels up.  That Hero can die and then will need to be resurrected, but he will retain his prior experience.  Also, his brade may seek vengeance.  In Generals, there are really two separate tiers where experience in accrued.  The first is individual unit experience - they acquire expertise in the course of normal skirmishes.  I've even seen experienced troops exit destroyed vehicles with their veteran status intact.  Though you personally have no representation on the field, the player also accrues experience through combat, conceptualized as ""Stars,"" which can be used to activate advanced units and abilities.  I think this system has more opportunities for dynamic combat flow.  The article I mentioned referred to their old way of doing things, and I just wanted to set it straight.  I bear Europe no ill will.  The only thing I did not like about Generals was the fact that it ran like shit.  And I mean shit.  Yes, it was the beta, but I always say ""It's the Beta"" to qualify why I say something runs like shit.  I bear no hope whatsoever for performance improvements in the retail product.     


My birthday is this Thursday, February sixth, and I do ask that you set aside some time that day to reflect not only on all the cool stuff I do, but also the cool way in which I do the stuff I was just talking about.

Just a couple quick updates. 


The few Penny Arcade shirts that are left are being taken off of Gameskins right now while we gear up for the new Penny Arcade store. I mentioned a few weeks ago that we are working with Kiko over at Gameskins to open a new official PA store with a bunch more shit in it. There are still plenty of other bad ass shirts over there to buy in the meantime though.


Instead of waiting for the new store to come online you should just come see us at the Seattle Comic Con. It looks like we will have our two new t-shirt designs available at our booth. The first one is the Div, ""zero to drunk in twenty dollars shirt"". 





The second is the highly anticipated, often imitated but never duplicated brand new Fruit Fucker shirt. We tried to keep it kind of tame so that you can still wear it to school and stuff. Only you and other PA fans will know that the orange on the back has just been totally fucking violated.





We will even have the new Card Board Tube Samurai posters available. It is 18x24 and its printed on a real nice glossy paper that I think will make them look shit hot.





We will also have a few of our old designs available as well as the posters we sold at the San Diego comic con last year. 


We have been told by the people who are organizing the con that we have a real nice booth location although I am not sure of the number or anything like that. We will have a good sized Penny Arcade banner up though so we shouldn't be hard to find. Tycho and I will be at the booth all day signing posters and stuff. It will be your first chance to pick up some of the new t-shirt designs and the CTS poster. Once the Con is over, those items will become available in our soon to be opened online store along with some other really cool stuff. I've heard talk of Div shot glasses but don't quote me on that. I don't have an ETA on the store yet but I am guessing maybe a month.


I hope to see a bunch of you at the Con, it should be a lot of fun.

26,2003-02-05,Retales,"
I worked retail for a long time, so these pages form the EB employee hand book stir up some pretty bad memories for me. People who have worked retail for any amount of time can share stories like veterans of some foreign war. It is a shared experience that allows people who would otherwise probably never get along to laugh and joke like old college buddies. 


My very first job when I was sixteen was as a ball boy at a golf course. I spent three years as a paid target and I can remember thinking that ""anything would be better than this shitty job"". My first Christmas working at Toys R Us made me long for the days of taking a well struck golf ball in the middle of my back and chasing coyotes off of the course with my ball picker. People who have worked retail wear their Christmas shifts like badges of honor on their blue and red smocks. For me the worst was Christmas 96, the year Tickle Me Elmo hit stores.  It's still hard for me to talk about even today. I watched old ladies get in fist fights over these plush red devils on a daily basis. I can still remember vividly Christmas Eve at midnight. There I was in the stuffed animal isle with a large white trash hick in a hunting vest yelling at me at the top of his lungs. I had just informed him that we were sold out of Elmo and he was not a happy wife beating drunkard. ""YOU BETTER PULL ONE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING ASS YOU LITTLE SHIT!"" Tiny bits of spittle hit my face as he yelled. I thought when I left Toys R Us and went to Circuit City to be a real salesman things would be different.


What I learned is that retail is retail no matter what your job title is. It doesn't matter if they call you a Sales Associate , a Customer Service Team Member or an EB Game Pro. You are working in retail and your life is pain and sorrow. Tycho mentioned that we met a manager at our Local EB who obviously subscribed to the insane philosophy of their handbook. Tycho never worked retail so I can forgive him this tiny mistake. What we encountered at EB that day was no mere manager. No, what we saw was something far worse. Anyone in retail could have spotted her a mile away and this same person, after identifying her for what she was would no doubt run as fast as they could in the opposite direction. What we saw that day was a district manager. These accursed demons travel from their own dimension to this one once every few months to terrorize the mortals they employ. They are grown in huge vats of blood and their tiny black brains, like bits of charcoal are filled with company propaganda from the day they open their leathery wings and take their first wobbly steps towards their BMW. Having never actually worked as a sales person for even a day all of their knowledge of sales comes from the company handbook, which they believe is infallible. 


Picture if you will a young Gabe, dressed in his red Circuit City shirt cleaning and organizing the computers in his department. Now picture the evil district manager, let's call him Rich since that is his name. Picture this hell sent monster swooping down on Gabe and cornering him against a wall. ""Why aren't you helping that customer over there?"" his forked tongue flicks in and out of his mouth as he speaks and his breath smells like rotting flesh. ""uh... Well they...uh, said they didn't need any help."" I am just barely able to get the words out. ""FOOOL!"" He cries. ""All customers need help! What did you say to them?!"" My eyes drop from his burning red face to the death grip he has on his Starbucks coffee cup. His sharpened black talons are threatening to crack the Styrofoam at any minute. "" I uh…asked if they needed any help and they said no."" He lets out a cry that shakes the very foundation of the store. I can hear the CD's playing in the Audio department skip as dust and debris rain down from the rafters. His face is only inches from mine now and his words are slow and deliberate. ""You never ask a customer if they need help. They will always say they are just looking. What you do is start a conversation with them."" I just pissed myself. ""What should I ask them?"" I stammer out. He raises up to his full height and unfolds his bat like wings. He is silhouetted against the four massive windows in front of the store. Outside it's snowing lightly and the road is busy with cars. I imagine where those cars are going. Are those people driving to jobs that that they hate as much as I hate mine? When his voice starts again it is like thunder and I am afraid. ""Tell them you have been inside all day and ask them if it is still snowing outside!"" A tiny voice in my head begs me not to tell him that the entire front of the store is made of glass and that it is plainly obvious to anyone with working eyes that there is snow falling.

Safety Monkey has posted everything I was going to say about MoO3 on his own site, and I am at a loss to add anything.  We've had many, many discussions about the game, and the fruits of those discussions have clearly nourished his end product.

31,2003-02-12,Crescent Fresh,"Gabriel, as a rule, is not in the business of liking things.  I suppose it was only a matter of time from his initial, uncharacteristic fascination to the unceremonious sloughing off, but this is not an activity without historical synonym.  In case you are wondering, yes.  For breakfast, I just tear pages out of the Thesaurus and eat them.   


I linked over to Safety Monkey's assessment of MoO3 yesterday because it said absolutely everything there is to know, and then a substantial portion that is not relevant to the simulation of galactic empires as such.  Then, as happens virtually every time I link there, his server was annihilated - and now, not only is there nothing to see over there, I didn't write anything here because there was no reason to.  I should probably touch on the subject.


MoO3 is awesome.  Now, the qualifications.
I have about fifteen hours under my belt, and I'll be direct with you and say that for the first few hours I thought the game would drive me mad.  People who have kept their Strategy Cortex well maintained on other massive management games might have an easier time with it, but this is not a ""game"" in the classic sense so much as it is an ""application.""  It is an interface designed to ease the management of a star empire.  Once you learn that, the rest is easy.
Part of what makes the initial hours so overwhelming is that the ""tutorial"" such as it is isn't all that great.  It consists of a verbose series of tooltips that are activated when you see a screen for the first time, and that block of text alongside this dense, intricate screen you've never seen before is like a one-two punch.  I took those off almost immediately.  Something else I did was grab the Prima Strategy Guide, something I don't do, but after the first time I played it I sat down with the guide and answered all of my questions before I went back in.  That is correct, I actively studied it like one would a textbook.
Here's the thing, and I think this is important.  I'm telling you that it's complex because I remember it being complex.  Now, when I look back, I try to figure out what I thought was so weird about it.  All the data is up front where you can see it, there's a handy encyclopedia built in, I honestly don't know how else they could have done the game proper.  The issue is that there is so Goddamn much information that you need to acclimate yourself to it.  What's more, though you could run your entire empire manually, even down to zoning individual regions of individual worlds for commerce, agriculture and the like, you certainly don't have to.  Though there is a lot to do, literally anyone could play it if they wanted to, because of the Viceroy.  Every world has certain aptitudes, and there is a virtual man on each planet that will handle all of the development, thank you very much.  If you want him to handle it, but you still want a say, you can - no shit - set policies that guide the Viceroys.  God, I love the word Viceroy.  You can say, ""I want my core worlds to focus on mining, research and agriculture in that order, I want the worlds on my borders to focus on defense and mining.""  You never need to think about it again, if you don't want to.
I think Quicksilver has balls.  Balls, balls, and more balls.  Balls of varying sizes, a collection of balls throughout the ages that look nice on the mantelpiece.  This is the sort of game that gave the PC its reputation for depth of strategy.  My secret fear is that the wide cross section of humans no longer desire a game like this, but I hope that retail is good to Master of Orion 3.
Visually, we are talking about some four-eighty-six type shit.  Obviously that doesn't make it bad, but listen to me here.  It is like a test from some wily and unpredictable gaming God, to see if you really mean it when you say that gameplay is all you care about.

I keep trying to get my mitts on that Goddamn 3DMark 03, to no avail.  Though it is supposedly some kind of benchmarking utility, I've only ever used it for that purpose on the rarest of occasions, when my hardware geek nature takes the fore.  The rest of the time, the 3DMark app is like a wonderful fantasyland projecting where in-game graphics may someday frolic.  I understand that the team behind 3DMark is largely comprised of people from the ""demo scene,"" which is obvious once you've seen it.  In the C64 era, the demo introductions on pirated software were often more amusing, to say nothing for better produced, than the games elsewhere on the floppy.

The strip is now unploaded properly.  Thank Goodness!   


If you were privy to Gabriel's late night wonderings regarding Capcom's new fighter for Xbox Live, you might have noticed that they have a strange character to them.  I saw it first hand when I was over yesterday.  The lag, even against opponents rated ""good"" for ping, can freeze matches for seconds at a time even in the middle of combos.  On the other hand, with all that lag, it's never your fault if you lose, so you play again.  It is a vicious cycle that will be played out on couches across the world, culturally appropriate couches for each nation of course.  


I can certainly understand why Infogrames might have held off on the release of MoO3 until the end of this month.  When I try to figure out what I'm going to play on a given night (or, let's be serious, very early morning), it is an excruciating procedure.  Apparently unsatisfied with the mine cart full of gaming riches recently released, for some reason I had to pick up the Ghost Recon ""Game of the Year"" edition.  If you will tolerate a bit of ancient hyperbole, it is totally awesome, which is something absolutely everyone else knew but me.  I own it primarily for the co-op, which lets you play any mission in the original or the included Desert Siege expansion as a focused cadre of sneaky bad-asses.  I'm still ruining lives and sundering the environment in SimCity 4, where the residents of New New Funkytown Town live suspended in raw sewage and spent syringes.  What has brought me the most joy recently is Road to Rome, the expansion for Battlefield 1942 that (near as I can tell) improves on it in virtually every way.  I know that there is/was some fervor over the fact that it only included six maps, but if you saw how these six maps and eight extraordinary vehicles alter and refine the game experience you would jump on a forum and type in all caps.  Add to this already dense lozenge of electronic entertainment EA Pacific's C&C Generals, which is fucking fresh.  The news has me all geared up for global conflict!   


Ubercon is upon us, I don't know if you had time to check it out.  Really, though - if your significant other is configured such that you can go to something like this on Valentine's Day, I mean, shit.  See what you can do about securing their affections into some kind of eternal union.

That means you should be seeing the new maps and 'Mechs any day now (my guess is by the end of next week). Since you waited so long we are going to combine the first four packages and release them all at once instead of a couple a weeks apart.

Today's strip may steer you wrong, as I am only messing with my associate Gabriel and not giving him factual data.  I suffered very little over the course of the movie, and (in fact) rather enjoyed many parts.  I was able to see it on Valentine's Day, yes, but that isn't to say I saw it with Brenna.  She might vote pro-geek in an election, but she's not a member of the party.  It is as though she's come to terms with some disease I have.    


I am patiently awaiting two scrumptious GBA SP systems today, hopefully I won't miss the delivery fairy.  The ""Platinum"" is for me, as I have an outfit that I think would go great with it, and the ""Onyx"" is for Monkey, as payment for his article on the new Zelda.  Is there a better editor anywhere on the planet?  I ask you.  I typically leap head-first into this importing thing because I haven't had any bad experiences yet, but I think I might have jumped the gun this time.  Instead of separate batteries, the GBA SP does the lithium-ion thing, which under most circumstances I wholly endorse.  The thing is, I'm sure it's going to come from Japan with some bizarre AC adapter that has a cat coming off of it or something, whatever it is I'm sure I need to deal with some voltage thing or other.  I'm also sure I know where to fix it, but I've always found hardware stores so emasculating.    


Gabriel mentioned the other day that EB (I think) had some kind of promotional thing set up to let you trade your GBA and fifty-nine bucks for a glimmering new SP, but most of the people I know have Afterburners installed - I doubt the Exchange Lords at Electronics Boutique will look kindly on Game Boys whose sensitive nether regions have been so augmented.  I gladly gave my old one to a friend who was going to Kalamazoo, which I assure you is a real place, but in the meantime that leaves me without any kind of console whatsoever that isn't sequestered away in a Uhaul box.  The only things left out, really, are the PC here and my katana, the infamous Arbiter of Kyushuu.   


I read an article regarding some connectivity issues with C&C Generals, stuff I can't confirm or deny because I usually need to complete a campaign or two to find out who I'm playing as.  Kiko has lamented many of the same problems, so I don't doubt for a moment that there is something to complain about.  Though I have never fully resolved myself to the zero-day patches that have become so commonplace, there is at least a portion of my brain (some kind of cortex?) that understands why there are business or technical realities that might make it happen.  I'll tell you what, though.  The shit that's going on now has no place.  C&C Generals and Battlefield 1942 - both from EA - both have patch patches out or on the way.  This is some Tribes 2 shit you've got going on now, and if you want to see just how completely you can erode the good will gamers have toward a franchise, please continue along this path.   


Under the right circumstances, and with the right people, I can be very charismatic.  I would ask that you good-for-nothing, power-lunching child predators take a moment to truly consider what would happen if a hundred thousand of the hard-core just stopped indulging your stupid asses one day.       


I'll wait.

36,2003-02-18,Computers,"
I have talked to quite a few people today about the Acer Tablet PC’s, including Acer Technical support. I will say first that I love the Tablet PC format, it has really changed the way I work. That having been said I think I probably picked the wrong model. This kind of shit just happens when you are a new technology whore like I am. 


The truth is that the touchpad not working was actually the second problem I had with my brand new Tablet PC. The other problem I had is that sometimes the screen just goes green. I started having to save my work constantly for fear that any minute the screen would decide it was done displaying my shit. A quick scan of some Tablet PC forums shows that this is an extremely common problem with the Acer. I figured I would just ride it out and hope a patch would be released soon or something. 


Then there is the latch on the Acer. Some people have had theirs replaced two or three times already. I could tell immediately upon first opening the PC that the latch was a pile of crap. My solution to this problem was to simply never use the latch. The result is my latch is still attached but it’s kind of stupid that I am forced to not use in it in order to keep it that way.


Then the touchpad went out on me and I got really frustrated. It was sort of like the straw that broke the camels back I suppose. I called Acer and they want ME to pay to have it shipped to them so they can take a look at it. We are talking about a machine that is barely three months old. Ass-bandits.


It’s too late for me now, I am stuck with this thing and I will have to make the best of it. If you are in the market for a Tablet PC, I highly recommend steering clear of the Acer models. They are great tools and I think every artist should at least try one out. Don’t be like me though, do your homework before you buy one.


Speaking of doing your homework before buying a PC, it’s time for me to get a new Desktop. My machine is currently a little over three years old and its sad little Athlon 1000 MHz processor and 512 MB of RAM just aren’t cutting it anymore. I have been doing a lot of work lately at insane sizes and resolutions for posters and stuff and I can hear the poor thing whimper every time I load up Photoshop. Saving a 36 x 24 inch graphic with multiple layers at 300dpi takes forever. I actually went and made a sandwich during one save on the CTS poster. What I want is a PC that is built for graphics and I honestly don’t really know what that is. I do however know that there are a lot of artists out there that read PA and I am hoping to get some advice. I am also seriously considering going Mac since artists seem to love them. Of course I am even more clueless when it comes to those. So hook me up, what do you think I should get and why?

I keep having trouble uploading strips, my apologies, but here you are.  


One would hope that after a few years exposed to Gabriel's ""unique"" perspective, any ideas you might have had about him not being a reprobate have dissolved entirely.  If his callous acts and intense, serial frivolity were not enough to set you right, behold!  Incontrovertible proof of his true nature, from the GamerTag Database.  The young man in the comments section there has described, indeed, compressed Gabriel into twelve words.  He was, of course, overjoyed.  


Because I like rumors, and I think that rumors are fun, lets talk about a rumor for a second.


I believe I'm on record as saying that the only console capable of Splinter Cell was the Xbox and maybe the GameCube.  Clearly, I fucked that one up.  For better or worse, the game is even coming out for the GameBoy Advance, though I'm not sure that counts for these purposes.  I still think I'm sorta right, but you can be the judge of that - there's still very little chance of downloadable episodes on any other platform, right?  I'm sure they'll make me regret that, too.


This Eurogamer article is all sunshine and roses for the PS2 port, which is fine by me.  I won't know until I play it how good it is.  But I think that it had to be good, great in fact, and it had to have exclusive content, because Splinter Cell was one of very few cases where you could say, ""Here is something you simply can't have on the PS2.""  Visually, it challenged the Playstation 2 to do better.  I am of the opinion that the PS2 release of the game is one part product and one part press release about the system's continuing technological viability.      


The rumor I heard goes like this:  Ubi Soft had no problems doing the GameCube version, but they had misgivings about trying to make the jump to the PS2 hardware.  So it is told, they refused to convert the game at all unless Sony itself paid for the graphics engine to be rebuilt from the ground up.  Like I said, I loves me some rumors so who knows if it is legitimate.  It does, however, fit my natural biases!  


You might remember the piece I did on Zettai Zetsumei Toshi for the Rising Fun section.  Looking online, I see that the U.S. release - called ""Disaster Report"" - should be in stores today.  I had no idea it had just come out actually, the reason I brought it up was this screenshot over at Gamespot that illustrates some of the points in my article.

The atrophy of Gabe's ability in Fighters is something for which I am at least partly to blame.  With few exceptions - Freeman and Iron Man, for example - I put up a mostly token resistance, so if he has come away from all these mock conflicts with the impression of indomitable personal prowess, no man could blame him.  Other than checking out those new maps and 'mechs, he has committed himself entirely to being abused in online matches.  The ability to hold ""tournaments,"" with spectators and the like, would be quite welcome - I'm curious if the imminent Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 will improve upon the current matching system.      


Those Goddamn GBA SP's showed up yesterday when I was over watching people injure Gabriel, so I guess I'll have to wait until later today.  I have had many requests from humans curious how it compares with the Afterburners they have already, and I'm right there with them.  The more compact size, I can give or take.  It's the light and the battery pack I'm in for, and if the light turns out to be only okay the status quo begins to make some very compelling arguments.  Hopefully I'll have it before I need to tear my computer apart, and I'll be able to kick out a quick note to all concerned parties.     


I'm really in the mood for an RPG at the moment, but if something breaks my concentration in the middle of a game - like moving, or whatever - I sometimes can't get back on task, ever.  I was playing Asheron's Call nightly for hours on end until I fled Chez Rats, and once I got into the new place, I played it long enough to buy some golden pants and that was it.  Of course, that didn't stop me from trying to buy Dark Cloud 2 yesterday, which I would have done, if it hadn't been sold out of every one of the four stores we went to.  Hopefully that's a good sign.  For RPG's, though, that's hardly the only game out this month - in fact, good luck even trying to play them all.  If Xenogears is any indication, good luck finishing its sequel (prequel, yeequel, whatever) Xenosaga before the year is out.   Our operative at the Bellevue mall GameStop swears by "".hack"", and he has a very sincere face.  There's also a new Breath Of Fire game, but I couldn't tell you what that means exactly, because I've never played one.  Tentatively, I am prepared to say it is as good as the others.       


I tried to buy Apex when Dark Cloud 2 didn't pan out, and for some reason no-one had that either.  At that point, though, I was primed for commerce - and I was able to bleed it off by purchasing a snappy reversible belt.  I sat down, reversing and unversing it, and wondered if my gut feeling about Apex was correct - had Ridge Racer 4 returned?  Ridge Racer 4, the one that showed me that racing games were, in fact, just games, and could be enjoyed independent of an irrational fixation on conveyances?  The controls were demanding without being simmy.  It had an almost RPG feel to it, your cars leveled up after races, and eventually changed shape altogether - but there were four different teams to race for, and all has specialties and unique progressions, in addition to a story, a strange story, but a story that carried you from race to race.  It was very engaging, and the reviews I've read of Apex make me hope.    


I do apologize for any brevity or lack of vigor the last few days.  It feels as though key portions of my brain are packed up, along with everything else.

We were in downtown Seattle today doing some business type shit for PA and we stopped by the EBX out there. We lucked out in that they had both of the games we wanted but were unable to attain over here on the east side. I picked up Apex and Dark Cloud 2 and Tycho just got Apex. 


Tycho mentioned earlier that he hoped Apex would be able to measure up to Ridge Racer 4 and after spending some time with it I'd have to say it does. Visually it's a knock out. Owners of HDTV's will delight to know that Apex supports 480p.  The reflection maps and various lighting effects on the road are some of the best I've seen. The cars handle really tight, I was power sliding with ease after just a few laps. The option of using your own soundtrack is abother killer feature. Nothing beats rocketing around hair pin curves on some European mountain while Crystal Method blasts through your speakers instead of the bland techno crap most racing games include. Calling all freaks indeed. 


Dark Cloud 2 is a bit harder to judge right now. I'm only on the second level of the sewer dungeons or whatever. Things I like so far are obviously the graphics which are killer and the music which is also fantastic. There are still some things I am not quite clear about involving the leveling up of your weapons and the spectralization or whatever of items. One of the best features in DC2 though is the built in help menu. Just about everything you could possibly have a question about is explained with video tutorials narrated by the characters. I am excited to spend more time with it.


My friend Robert and I are going to attempt to construct our own fighting sticks for use on CvS2. I have a bit of experience with this. I did a bit of rudimentary wiring on the two arcade machines I have. Hopefully I won't solder any parts of my own body this time. That shit is hot. watch out.

He has spoken about it on several occasions here in the post - and indeed, on the lecture circuit, with a presentation entitled ""Four Wheels And A Dream: Success The Gabriel Way"" - so I needn't laud it anymore than he already has.  I simply want to confirm what he has said with genuine enthusiasm.  It was the first game I played once I had something set up to play it on. 


The thing I have heard the most about Apex is actually the thing I've heard a lot of since November - Does it have Live support?  Come to think of it, the answer is much the same, too - No.  I'm already on record as thinking that Live is a Good Thing, and this statement isn't meant to change my official position or something.  I just wonder if they knew when they put the service out there that it would engender dissatisfaction with regular old, run of the mill excellent games that didn't happen to be on the service.    


Also, I find myself wondering what an online racer could be.  Clearly, you drive around a track with other players and determine the winner.  We've got to keep that.  While welcome, we will see this iterated a hojillion times over with each racer's physics, controls, and signature cars.  Auto Modellista, a Capcom racer we imported from the island nation of Japan, seemed to have a fairly complete online experience that we simply couldn't connect to.  I want to know what happens next.       

Rally-style racing where your co-pilot (I'm sure there's a fancy, racy name for them) has a view out the windscreen and a picture of the map, and calls out the turns over the voice connection.
Downloadable ghosts of the best online players.
Racing as teams, with custom insignias.
Apex has a sort of ""Brand Management"" game that underpins the racing - specifically, successful races equate to more sales of your cars, and these sales can be plowed into your business.  It might be interesting to see how that played out in a multiplayer context.
PC racers I've never played have probably been doing some of this stuff for years, but for some reason I just never enjoyed any computer racing games outside of Ignition and Big Red.  I know that there is a passel of console driving games coming out with online support, in fact, the sequels to many of the inaugural Xbox racing games should have it.  I'm happy about that.  You should see me, I'm over here all happy.  I just want to know what else they're bringing along.

Precious Broadband, you are a proper noun.  How I have missed you.


First they said the Xbox was failing, now it's Nintendo, after that it will be the Xbox again, and then after that maybe more Nintendo.  It's just what analysts do, they analyze things and make charts.  Since the N64, I've thought of Nintendo's home consoles the same way I think of Pocket Rockers.  Do you remember those?  I'm not trying to say they are for girls.  They're both proprietary formats that exist for little other reason than to be proprietary.  I'll never begrudge Nintendo the right to make their little vanity devices, so long as their first party games continue to exhibit that Must Play perfectionism.


Just before we moved I was a ten-round-a-day Road to Rome man, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm looking forward to getting back in.  God damn.  The daring raids, the lucky shots.  I even enjoy the old maps more now, and the expansion doesn't do shit to those.  I'd heard that the single player was actually pretty fun, and that is a fucking lie, unless a lobster falls out of the special seafood freezer you keep above your monitor and hits the ""single player"" button you have no excuse being in there.  Then again, offline may be the only time you can actually get to an airplane.  We're sort of waiting on Gabe's new machine at the moment - I told him I would build him one, but he seems to like those guys - and he's going to get this game on there even if I have to buy it for him, install it myself, sit him down in the chair, and wag a stern finger at the screen.  Maybe he can take a break from getting his ass kicked in online fighters, and come get his ass kicked with us in another game.  


Though I'd never publicly lamented it, I am sort of sad that the planned console version of Battlefield 1942 was cancelled.  It's an excellent PC game, one of the best I can recall, but I believe it could really make its mark in that context.  Throw in a little built-in voice, a little real-time lip syncing, it would be like Team Fortress 2, if Team Fortress 2 were not wholly mythological!            


I'm going to turn up the dork for a moment.


It was agony to me, but the place I used to live had no storage to speak of and many of my prized obsessions had to remain at my grandparents' house.  I have them all back now:  virtually every world and boxed set from TSR's Second Edition Dungeons and Dragons Heyday, a king's library of geek literature.

I mentioned about a month ago that we got a kitty. Well we brought her back from the vet the other day and discovered that now we had a kitty and some fleas. I don’t know if the vet charged us extra for the fleas as I didn’t scrutinize the bill as well as I probably should have. Perhaps it was just flea day at the vet and we happened to be the thousandth customer. At any rate Kara and I decided that, while we liked the cat the fleas had to go. Kara ran to the store and bought a flea collar, flea comb and some special shampoo. Yeah shampoo, those of you with cats can already see where this story is heading. 


I have never tried to give a cat a bath before so I sat down and read the instructions on the shampoo bottle. “Wet cat” it said, then “work shampoo into a lustrous lather” and rinse. What the bottle didn’t say is that as soon as your cat gets the first tiny droplet of water on its paw the situation changes dramatically. No longer are you trying to give your cherished pet a bath to rid it of the fleas that are driving it crazy. No, now you are trying to wash an angry, furry chipper shredder that is howling like an air raid siren. 


Everyone knows that cats don’t like water. You can ask any five year old, “what do cats not like?” and they will tell you water.  To say that cats do not like water though isn’t really accurate. For instance I do not like peas. However if Kara were to serve me peas I would not grab a kitchen knife and begin slashing wildly at the exposed parts of her body while scrambling for the nearest exit and screaming at the top of my lungs. 


We finally got the cat washed and then began the process of combing her with the flea comb. After we could run the comb through her without picking up any of the little bastards we attached the flea collar and called it good. We vacuumed the hell out of the apartment and washed all the sheets and stuff. I still feel crawly things all over me though which is unsettling. I hope it’s all in my head. Does anyone have any tips for making sure your apartment is flea free? I would love to hear them.

The forces of Continuity will not be stayed long, and you may be sure that they wait in the space between moments, all craft and cunning.  Time has no meter to them, they are not bound by it, and also they don't carry watches so it could be five in the morning or six in the afternoon, they really have no idea.  Nothing seems more Penny Arcade to me than a flight of fancy, some unauthorized adventure that seizes the site.  We certainly hope that you enjoy the Cardboard and Steel miniseries, but if you don't, there's really nothing we can do for you. 


We have ads for Harbinger up this month, and they have a tag-line which says ""It's Diablo In Space!"" or something to that effect.  I've played it, and I won't disagree with that ebullient proclamation.  That's exactly what it is.  Do you know what else is Diablo In Space, though?  It might surprise you.  It's called ""Freelancer.""


I don't know if it started out this way, or if it got to this point during one of the periods the game was incommunicado, but it makes me want to get down on my knees and thank Jesus.  I'm fixated on it now in the same way that one gets fixated on a Diablo-type game, where one must click frequently or become agitated.  You might recall how when you lop off a zombie head or whatever, a wonderful fountain of goods bursts from their centers like flavor.  This is the same thing!  You're flying around with the mouse, which is fun and not dumb, you blast a ship with your friend Safety Monkey, and then riches leap like embers out of the wreckage.  I want you to imagine a pinata in space.  You hit ""B,"" and a tractor beam just snatches them all up.  At once.  Sometimes you need to get escape pods and bring them back, whatever.


When I was picking up loot and doing missions co-op in the multiplayer mode, it felt very much the same as Diablo.  I began to cinch up other comparisons,  and this did it too:  You are (of course) aware of the ""potions"" in Diablo.  When you're running low on health, you drink a potion - they're right there, and they're delicious.  You just hit a button, they don't try to make it any more of a pain in the ass than it has to be.  In Freelancer, you have shields and armor, but unlike many space sims your protection isn't divided into Quadrants or anything, you can't have low shields in one area and healthy shields in another, you have a single bar that represents in a general way how shieldy you are.  When it gets low?  Drink a potion, I mean, drink a shield battery.  Or use one.  Again, you just hit a button, and you can carry a bunch of these things - one of the main reasons to upgrade your ship is that they each have a different carrying capacity for restorative items.        


It has a single player campaign, and that's fine, I respect that.  One day I might play it.  The ""retail"" version I'm playing also has a bit more polish (polish, not Polish) visually, though the geometry and textures on large stations are not without fault for a modern game.  All I do is start up my server, Monkey joins up, and we go out and amass wealth.  It's actually a pretty good time.  When you run a server for Freelancer, it's a little more elaborate than for Quake or whatever - anytime you play online, you're accruing prestige on a specific server, it's not stored on your machine.  So when someone joins my game, they'll see a list of the guys they have on there and select one of those.  We've enlisted a couple friends of ours as ""extra support"" and ""cargo hauler"" respectively, and I have a tip on some H Fuel in the Colorado system we can move into California at a pretty price, provided the Outcasts don't waylay us en route.

47,2003-03-04,I love me some CTS,"I am heading out of town tomorrow but I wanted to make a quick update. 
Today’s comic strip kicks off the CTS mini series that Tycho and I have been itching to do for a long time now. Over the ten or so years that Tycho and I have been friends we have created our fair share of comic book characters. I won’t go into the embarrassing details but just know that one of them was named Maximum and he was a mute…Jesus. Anyway, CTS is really special to me and when we decided that we were going to tell a long form CTS story I wanted to do something special with it. 


I decided to draw and ink each page by hand rather than use the computer. I just felt like the look I was after would be easier to capture with more traditional methods. I am still adding in all the grey scale stuff and text in Photoshop but all the line work is good old pen and ink. It has been a long time since I worked this way and it’s a lot of fun. I just wrapped up the page that you guys will see Wednesday and I’m really proud of how this mini series is turning out. Each page is taking about eight hours to do and I am loving every minute of it. I am learning a lot and hopefully that will show in the work.


I hope you can indulge us for a few weeks while we get this out of our systems. I think Tycho has crafted quite a tale here and I’m really excited to be sharing it with you guys. Obviously if Microsoft buys Sega or IGN starts writing decent reviews we will interrupt the CTS storyline for a little PA fun. In the meantime though I really hope you enjoy what we’ve cooked up for you.

I want to stress that I use the term ""epic"" rather loosely, for example - I think my belt is rather epic.  This page is really cool, by the way.  That's something I can get away with saying because I had very little to do with it.  The first panel of the strip has been fashioned into a wallpaper, if you are so inclined.    




There are some bits of Penny Arcade news that need to be communicated.

One, my friend and associate Plastik360 is completing a scrumptious RSS feed for Penny Arcade.  I'm in no position to tell you what that stands for, something with R, but I suspect that many heads are nodding in unison.  The long and the short of it is that it will allow easy, multiplatform content tracking for our strips and posts which can be digested by apps like Kontent for OSX, a sort of news reader that utilizes this feature.  Anyway, when he told me about it, it sounded like a cool idea and I couldn't think of any reason why not.
Two, humans have expressed some agitation over our boycott of the Amazon Honor System.  Many people feel that Paypal is at least in league with Satan, if not itself the Sovereign of Hell.  I respect that.  It is the hope that our upcoming online store, set for launch this month, will have some functionality of this kind.
Three, on the Club PA tip, it pleases me to announce that I have sent the gift out to every e-mail address I have.  Of course, if you donated through Amazon, I never got it - please mail me at ClubPA@penny-arcade.com and I will get you squared away.  That e-mail address is meant to serve a sort of ""Customer Service"" role, if you have any problems with your membership at all feel free to communicate those concerns to me via that account.  I think I might take over the sending out of the gift, HomeLAN gave me some pretty bad-ass tools to get the job done.

I always knew that people had misgivings about communists, but I never understood why until I was laid low, ravaged by one of their Red Colds.  This is like watching someone's slides from their trip to Agony.  There is the Great Gulf of Torment.  There is the River of Unpleasant Moisture.    


Still waiting on the strip, I did mention it might be a little late -  this link will work fine once it hits the site.  He had some cool ideas on how to represent certain things, and it might have taken longer, but when this is all done I want to go back through the archive and say that we did our God Damnedest on every page.  Also, I would like to one day combine it with Over Easy, The Christmas Carol, and Fall of the House of Brahe along with extra stuff in a book maybe.  I think we could do a good job on that.     


I do, of course, appreciate your patience in this matter.  A man came up to me at the San Diego Comic-Con and asked me what I think the most important element of an online strip is, and I told him ""Punctuality,"" so obviously the situation makes me feel like a dumbass.  It's still true, however.  I told him that I felt punctuality trumped writing and art for long-term success, and I certainly hope that I am right because, well...  Imagine the alternative.


I have tried act as a bulwark against insidious Continuity for a very, very long time.  Indeed, I have railed on about it in the post virtually every time the notion of a storyline rears its scaly head.  Part of the problem, as I have mentioned, is that we simply don't have the attention span for extended narratives.  Couple that with the fact that we are not a daily strip, and the possibility of making readers slog on for, oh, three months through some poorly conceived storyline finds no purchase here.  We tried for years to write storylines to no avail, and the moment we switched to strips five years ago things started to work better for us.  I thought continuity just didn't like me, it's like in elementary school where deep down everyone is just terrified and there is a lot of projected enmity.                     


This is actually a good time to introduce our delectable RSS feed, as it will help notify you when the strip becomes available.  It can be found at ""http://www.penny-arcade.com/RSS.xml"" - there are, no doubt, a plurality of options for parsing that file.  The guy who wrote the feed made a reader for OSX called Kontent, which I mentioned before - the newest version, uploaded late last night, has support for ours.  I'm not familiar with the Linux side of things, but I know that here on Windows the ""Pro"" version of Trillian has a cool little plug-in that will keep up with the site and notify you in an adorable little box.  I believe programs of this type are called ""Aggregators,"" if you do a search for that, you'll find riches beyond your wildest dreams.  For example, Amphetadesk is free and cross platform, so there's a start.  These are applications that can keep track of Penny Arcade and probably thousands of other sites.  If you really like cats or something there's probably a cat one.

Photoshop purrs like a goddamned kitten even when I'm fucking with giant files with too many layers. In fact the first time I saved I thought that it hadn't actually done it because I didn't see the little bar chugging away at the bottom. I actually went and looked in the folder to see if it had really been saved. 


Just this morning I noticed that the video card supports two monitors. I am gonna fuck around with that a bit and see if I can't use my tablet PC as a second monitor. I am thinking about using that display for all my tools and menus in Photoshop. This would free up some real estate on my 19"" monitor and give me more room to work. 


The first game you install on a new PC is always special. I broke in my new rig last night with Freelancer. It runs like a dream.

Page four of Cardboard and Steel is now available.  Only two more to go, I've passed the rest of the scripts on to Gabe so my involvement is pretty much over.  I didn't actually know he was doing each of these pages in full color and then switching them to gray-scale, he tried other methods apparently but this produces the desired result.    He's already well into the one for Wednesday, which means that barring a meteor strike you'll have what you came for when you came for it.  Unless, of course, you came for the newspost - in which case, I abuse you regularly with late product.  That porn's not going to watch itself, people.  You need to get an early start.

I would like to tell you all about the daring runs we made from the Cortez system in Freelancer last night, hulls pregnant with valuable Polymers and Engine Parts, but that would be something of an exaggeration - and here at Penny Arcade, we frown on hyperbole.  Just as things started to get interesting, the game just stopped working and kicked me to the wallpaper.  It's a nice wallpaper, so I didn't mind all that much.  It's not Digital Anvil's fault, either - the game actually works much as presented on the box!  If Motherboard Monitor is correct, there is a new sun is forming inside my case. 

Believe me, I'm as surprised as anybody.  


And it's not that I don't like suns, I just like them a bit farther away is all.  God only knows why it was an average of ten degrees hotter in that case than it was the day before, but clearly I need some kind of valuable goo or piece of modern art in there to offset the Goddamn star.  My e-mail is still pretty screwed up from my move, as anyone who has tried to mail me is no doubt aware - but dammit if I couldn't use some advice at this point.  Actually, shit - it's out of character, far out of character in fact, but I'm going to start a forum thread about it, and if you know what the hell I need to do about cooling this thing I'm all ears.  I'll put all my hardware in the post over there.  Is it a problem that I've stuffed every modern piece of equipment into a mini case from 98?  Please write back!       


There is a con at the end of this month in Kansas City, and I think we will probably go to it.  We started to feel bad that all the things we go to are in the extreme west of the country, and so we have a two-step plan to balance that out.  For one, like I said, this Kansas Con should get us much farther out than is typical.  Gabe knows the site of that con, on the 29th or something, I'll just let him handle it.  Also, in addition to the annual Necrowombicon - taking place this summer in Vancouver, BC - there will also be a Necrowombicon Dallas that should get us somewhere else we haven't been.  People have come  so far to see us at the events we've held, it is high time we returned the favor.

I haven't had much time for games lately which sucks because I am not nearly as far into Dark Cloud 2 as I would like to be. Obviously the positive side is I spent all that time working on the CTS mini series which I feel is probably my best work to date. I took some time off from the insane schedule I have been on this afternoon and I played some Kung Fu Chaos with Robert, a guy who used to be my friend. The fact that he is no longer my friend has nothing to do with Kung Fu Chaos and everything to do with Guilty Gear X2.


At any rate I wanted to comment on Kung Fu Chaos which I have seen take a beating in a few reviews. This is from the IGN review:



""...when playing multiplayer, it was never a joy. I've yet to play with anyone who wasn't totally frustrated, annoyed, or bored by the game in a multiplayer match. Everyone I've tricked into player single-player has had fun. But, the multiplayer just isn't good.""



Just because all of Hilary's friends are dumb shits she says the multiplayer is bad. I don't blame Hilary for not being able to find a single person who liked the game at IGN. I mean that place is where writers go when they don't get hired by Maxim. These guys are practicing their craft at the bottom of the proverbial barrel. I can't even imagine the bunch of sour faced rejects she must have to put up with on a daily basis. All desperately sawing at their wrists with the plastic butter knife they swiped along with an extra pudding cup from the cafeteria. ""Hey Frank I know you said you had to get home early tonight so you could sit in your garage with the engine running until you were released from this cosmic joke that is your life, but instead why don't we play a fun little party game with a corny ""chop-socky"" kinda vibe."" Yeah, probably not gonna happen. But the fact is, with a good bunch of friends this game is really a blast.


The game is divided between long dynamic levels and what are essentially mini games. The longer levels will have you and your buddies battling through film sets while the director shouts insults and orders at you. You will be jumping between moving boats and charging across crumbling wooden bridges. Each character has a bunch of combos they can do and you can pick people up and toss them around which is always fun. It's basically just a really good party game that will have you and your friends shouting insults at each other which is the whole point of a party game. So don't pay attention to the bad reviews, they have no idea what they are talking about. The game is a blast and you should definitely get some friends together and check it out.


In other News, The response to this months Club PA gift has been overwhelming. I'm glad that you guys are so excited about seeing the CTS mini series in color. Once I have page six done I'll compile the whole thing and send it off to Tycho. I don't know if he will want to wait and send it out along with page six of OE when that is done or if he will just send the CTS stuff out right away. At any rate we really appreciate your support .


As long as you are so keen on supporting us why not come see us at the Kansas City Comicon on March 29th and 30th. We will have a good sized booth there from which we will be peddling our PA wares. This includes Div and Fruit Fucker shirts as well as the new CTS shirt. We will also have the CTS and PA crew posters.

If you want to get all your buddies together for a road trip Tycho even said he would pay for all your gas to get there. I know!

The sixth and final page of Cardboard and Steel is up.  This story encapsulates everything else we do with the CTS that is ""narrative"" in any way, with future installments named along ""The Wandering Age: X"" conventions.  God only knows when we would do something like this again, or what form it would take - even though it was highly enjoyable for us, I doubt any return to the topic will be soon.  We are dedicated adherents to ""the path of least resistance,"" and this much extra work for a daily update is highly uncharacteristic of us.  Although, if you just can't get enough of it (which seems inconceivable, but we live in a world of deep and enduring mystery), don't forget that the full color version goes out to Club Members this month along with the sixth page of Over Easy.     


Inbetween imagining tales for samurai who fight using garbage and flipping through Wizards' (excellent) new d20 Modern, I have been wondering if our world is fucking insane.  


I won't afflict you with the entire litany because I don't think that's why people read the things I write, to be exposed to surreal political views which are completely unmoored from reality.  I would, however, draw your attention to the following article, which details a congressional hearing on the links between terrorism and, um...  peer-to-peer file sharing.


John G. Malcolm, deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice, did say there seems to be some connection between illegal copying and organized crime, in that many of the groups profiting from illegal copies are highly organized and can have international distribution networks. Organized crime often supports terrorism, he suggested.


""These groups will not hesitate to threaten or injure those who tend to interfere with their operations,"" Malcolm said.



This is the first statement I have ever read where Manga speechlessness - ""..."" - is the only valid response.


Statements of this kind gnaw at the sensible mind, they chew on it and try to eat it.  I won't even gauge the clumsiness with which these two incongruous concepts are lashed together.  If you want to see triple-x, explicit evidence of corporations with their hands up your government's ass, working the their jaws like some malevolent Howdy Doody with chilling ramifications for personal liberty, well, there you go.  Peer-to-peer file sharing and Terror?  Terror?  Do they not have dictionaries there?  There's another T word you cocks might like, too -  give it a try:  it's called ""Tenuous.""  The only people terrorized by peer-to-peer file sharing are vastly potent multinational businesses, gripped by the realization that they sell carriages in a world of bullet trains.      


I mentioned Amplitude on Wednesday, and just so you know the PSM I grabbed yesterday has a playable demo of it on there - it's got two songs and three or so difficulty levels.  I was hoping for a chance to play around with remixing, alas, that was not to be.  I comfort myself with the knowledge that the release is only ten days hence, at which time I will get down immediately.  


Also - you might have noticed the X-Arcade spot to the right of the post.  You might be familiar with them already if you're into fighters at all, as their multiplatform sticks have drawn high praise from virtually every quarter.  X-Arcade, like Sega next week and Nintendo soon after, have decided to try short runs with us to see if we're worth investing in.  Without putting too fine a point on it, I need you to prove that we are.

We continue to produce comic strips.  


This just in, from our Omphaloskepsis Department:  


Nightly gaming with the group has resumed, after a hiatus of unprecedented length.  The game that did it wasn't Freelancer, as I was starting to think, or even Generals, which has gathered something of a following crew-wise.  Now that Gabriel has a computer worthy of the title, Battlefield 1942 (and the Rome expansion) have consumed every evening since his purchase.  I know there is some tension about whether or not Road to Rome is a worthwhile investment, particularly in the face of two solid, free content drops for Unreal Tournament 2003.  People said the same thing when Quake III:  Team Arena came out, as you'll recall.  I love UT2k3, I loved it even when you weren't supposed to.  The latest Bonus Pack is almost breathtaking in its scope.  The problem with the new UT is that it has several compelling gametypes under the same conceptual roof, and a surfeit of servers up for people to play on.  That doesn't sound like a bad thing, but as a practical matter there are rarely full games of the types I want to play at the times I want to play them.  With Battlefield, you've only got Conquest and CTF to speak of, really, and though CTF is more fun than I expected Conquest is really the point of the game.  As a result there are always a few games with 60 pings just on the verge of 32 players waiting for our crew to lay shit out.


Generals might have been an interesting choice as a crew game, and I'm still quite committed to it myself, but real-time strategy titles simply don't lend themselves to hopping in with a four or five man group and playing for a few hours.  Ground Control might have done that, and Battlezone II, to be sure - but games that follow a more tried and true approach to the genre and don't manhandle its conventions don't seem to work right, for our group at least.  Generals is, in my opinion, and excellent, creative game, but it has rough technical edges (being slowly ground down by patches, I suppose) and some steep-ass sysreqs that serve to keep people out.  Their matchmaking is as ugly as sin, but I suppose that's neither here nor there.    


Our Nintendo hook-up has come through again, delivering unto us the new Zelda und Bonus Disc.  I'm told by my associate Gabriel that it looks very nice in progressive scan, and if I were some kind of home theatre weirdo maybe I could clap my hands and do a little dance or whatever.  He still hasn't quite forgiven me for playing the import, as he and I had a pact not to watch videos or look at screenshots or read about the story, but then I did all those things.  In any case, I'm glad that he can see now what I've been talking about:  the way tones play with each strike on a foe, the imaginative visuals, and the centerpiece Link whose eyes convey volumes of context and meaning.  You'll see, you'll see.  


I wanted to note that if you enjoyed ClanBOB, artist/writer guy Dan Jaaren has produced a Long-Form Thing and has chosen to distribute it in an interesting way.  They also asked me to write a forward for it, which I did with a glad heart.

We did a comic about it already but I think it's funny that I go for months without playing my Gamecube and then when I DO play it the game I play is amazing. From Mario Sunshine to Metroid to Zelda these are absolutely stellar titles. Zelda in particular stands out as one of the most polished gaming experiences I've ever had. Let the kids argue in their forums about its ""new look"" if they want to. They think it looks stupid or corny or whatever and that is to be expected. The fact is, most people don't appreciate art and that is what Zelda is. A group of children giggling in front of a nude painting doesn't mean it's a terrible painting. They simply are not sophisticated enough to appreciate it. It is the same with Zelda. Don't let the idiots dissuade you from picking up this game and enjoying it for what it is,  an unparalleled and inspired work of interactive art.

It occurred to me that today's comic might be too specific to the new Zelda to post before the actual release, but then it occurred to me that that's how it works in practically every game.  The money you find just laying around has to belong to somebody, even if you don't care who, and it's always in some fanciful pot or buried in some guy's lawn.  It's been said that I am all about the rupees, and it's a charge I don't deny.  My mind is constantly dominated by thoughts of their acquisition and expenditure.      


Zelda every day, Battlefield every night.  As good as this arrangement was, apparently it wasn't enough - I grabbed Raven Shield on Wednesday, and I don't regret it.   


I wish I knew more about the other games in the series, so I could tell you if they finally improved the accuracy on the MP5SD5 or whatever, but I'm not that guy.  All my counter-terror experience comes by way of de_dust, so this pace is quite a change for me.  I have been playing the multiplayer and single player tests as they've come out, and I've enjoyed them, but I do not know that there is anything that could have prepared me for what happened in that cafe last night.  The flashbang hit the pane over the door and went through, the blast covering me with glass outside the window - when Lieutenant Monkey and I burst in, two of them were still rubbing their eyes.  My frag in the other window had apparently blown the back door into match sticks, and a stream of terrorists and poor English issued from that direction.  After clearing that room, I covered the door while the Lieutenant produced a heartbeat sensor, scanning both floors for opposition.  There was one close, actually, just to the right inside the door.  I opened it a crack (pretty easy to do in this game, you use the wheel), lobbed in another flash, and shut the door.  After hearing its report, we burst in the door and did our work, only to fall to a heavy machine gun in another corner.  We have played this map, the same map, about thirty times now and we're still not sick of it.     


The Artificial Intelligence is alright, sometimes crafty, sometimes inane.  But even if an idiot shoots you with a Desert Eagle, you stay shot, you know?  As I mentioned, I have this game (like I have Ghost Recon) almost explicitly for the cooperative multiplayer, which means that I don't actually know how the story progresses and I've never so much as seen the ""Planning"" screen, where you can set waypoints for teams and whatnot.  So while I commend them on including a mode where co-op grooves may be gotten on, and I will gladly commit myself to it, the illusion is far from complete.  Indeed, when setting up multiplayer games I don't even know what order the missions go in, because it doesn't say.  I'm going to dig around in the manual and play more today, see if maybe there are ways to set waypoints in-line for your fellow operatives or something, which would at least be a start.    


Last E3, I had an appointment to see a game called ""Devastation"" that had interesting technology and solid level design - even if the booth was situated in Kentia Hall, where games go to die.  When one of the guys I know there asked if we'd advertise it, I didn't turn him down - and not just out of avarice.  There's a demo out now I haven't had a chance to grab, though that's probably something I'll do today.

61,2003-03-24,Zelda!,"
The debate rages on in my mail box regarding Zelda and the mean things I said to the people who don't like it. You will notice that we have a new Zelda ad over on the right side of the page today. I think that those of you suggesting some kind of Nintendo Fanboyism on my part would do well to look at today's cartoon before you send me anymore mail on the subject. Tycho and I don't have any special loyalties to any companies...well besides Sprite. What we do is try and support good GAMES whether they be on the GC, the PS2 or God help us even on the XBox.


With that said I would like to reiterate my stance that Zelda is one of the finest gaming experiences I have ever had. This week Nintendo is sort of testing the Penny Arcade waters with an ad that will only run for a couple days. You might remember Sega did the same thing last week. You might also remember that we asked you to please click the hell out of that ad for us. Well I thought I'd share a couple figures with you just so you know how you guys did and to sort of keep you in the loop. First you should know that the industry average click through rate (how many times an ad is shown vs. how many times it gets clicked) is under 1 percent. In fact I think it's something like .5 percent right now. I thought that was crazy until I thought about how many times I have ever actually clicked on an ad. The click through rate for the Sega ad we ran last week was almost 7 percent. You guys are the shit. We were actually worried that Sega would look at the numbers we had and think we were lying. So if it would be possible for you guys to leverage that same kind of clicking ferocity against this new Nintendo ad we would certainly appreciate it.


I'll probably be back with more later but I have to go get my hair cut. I want to look nice for the people in Kansas this weekend.

62,2003-03-26,Dear Factor 5,"
Gabe will most likely be very busy today wrapping up this month's gift and Monday's comic, so we may not get to hear an extended version of his plea to Factor 5.  We actually cracked out Rogue Squadron II for the Cube fairly recently, it's still very beautiful, and it's still very difficult.  But like Gabe, I have a difficult time kindling much enthusiasm for another action game set in the context of the original trilogy.  That isn't even a comment on those movies - I've just always preferred the more adventurous forays into Star Wars mythology, games that take more license with the license.  The New Jedi Order fiction seems as good a place to start as any.  


The official Star Wars site does include a good bit of information on the Expanded Universe for fans like myself who are perhaps not dedicated enough to read like fifty fucking books.  Even at that, there are still some names gamers might recognize.  Also, I might receive a mean mail from Gabe (well, another mean mail) if I don't show you a Chiss Clawcraft.  I can't bring myself to argue with him about it, I wouldn't mind taking it for a spin.


I'm still giddy from last night's Battlefield.  After some ignominious defeats in Stalingrad and some invigorating successes in Berlin, the map switched to Kharkov.  I like the Pacific Theater, and I also think the Africa maps are spot on - but Kharkov really has it all, in my opinion.  For one, the aesthetics are sound.  The wreckage has good feng shui, it's very tasteful.  The geography is also noteworthy - the conflict takes place on three stacked levels of elevation, the uppermost portion sporting plateaus and artillery pieces in perfect position to shell either base.  Battles were heated, but as it so often happens in Battlefield one team gets an upper hand and it's hard to shake them out of it.  It wasn't us, by the way.  They had about seventy tickets on us at one point, and though I was trying to make a difference I mainly stayed on the server just to get to the next map.  Providence smiled on us, or something did, might have been Providence, and we were able to maintain two points while their ticket lead slowly evaporated - but our stock of thirty-five spawns didn't look braced to hold it.  It got down to the last ticket, and the round I thought for sure we'd lost came around.  We've had a few upsets like this lately, for and against us.  For all the good things I enjoyed about the game, I was never sold on the ""attrition"" style gameplay, where it becomes less and less likely to bounce back once you lose the upper hand.  I think that I just didn't understand it.  You can bounce back, but it's not going to happen doing what you've been doing up to that point.  The large maps, useful vehicles, and the full roster of professions can be combined by desperate men in devastating ways.

Otogi is like Shinobi only with better graphics, better music, better level design, a more robust combat system including the ability to purchase new weapons and magic that will alter your characters stats and combos, tighter controls and a camera that actually works. The fact that most stores are only ordering half of a copy though means it might be difficult to get your hands on one. Once again the Pre-ordering system fucks the average gamer in the ass. It's the same thing that happened with REZ, ICO and APEX. They don't get many pre-orders so they only get in a few copies. Then everyone realizes what an awesome game it is and you can't fucking buy it anywhere.


I don't understand why I can't just walk into a game store and buy a videogame. I don't have to talk to some jackass over at Safeway three months before I wanna buy some milk. ""Yeah bob listen, I'm gonna want to get my hands on some frozen yogurt come next December. How about I leave you a ten spot and you call me when my shit comes in."" The entire Pre-ordering system helps no one except EB, Gamestop and the dozen or so other game stores that are all really just the same store but they call them a different name so that you don't feel like one giant mega-company is taking all your money even though that's totally the fucking case. 


Maybe we should do something about this. I'm not sure just what yet but I think that if we all decided that we wanted this to change we could probably do that. Let's all put our thinking caps on and see what we can come up with. The sooner I don't have to hear ""I'm sorry, did you have a pre-order?"" the fucking better.


On a completely unrelated note I would like to continue my ""helping people out"" streak that I started with my plug for Red Eye PC yesterday. Only this time I'd like to plug my own wife. Hmmm…that didn't come out quite right. In any case Kara is in school right now learning how to manipulate hair in new and exciting ways. Now she is actually out on the floor cutting and styling the hair of real human beings which is a comfort to me as I no longer find terrifying mannequin heads all over the house. So if you're in need of some kind of hair maintenance she would very much appreciate your patronage. Keep in mind this is a school and she is a student but I can vouch for her skills. She's taken her shears to me on numerous occasions and I've come through with hardly a scratch on me. It also means that you get a good deal on your hair cut. Gene Juarez is a super shmancy salon but at the school a haircut is only like ten bucks. If you are in the Seattle area just call the Gene Juarez academy at 206-365-6900 and tell them you want to schedule an appointment with Danica. Yeah, I know her name is Kara but they have a bunch of girls at the school with similar names so she had to pick a new one.

Here is the dream my exhausted mind produced after this convention:


A combination of Greg Kasavin and our friend Stephen from London was coming into town, and we had decided to have a LAN party at my house from the sixth grade.  I assure you that this is not an exaggeration, in fact, I am no doubt leaving out a host of other incongruities.  In any case, many of the dorks in attendance claimed (rather facetiously) that we were going to ""go out on the town"" and ""meet some laydays"" when the truth couldn't have been more remote.  We were, in fact, ""staying right there"" and ""Playing Soldier of Fortune 2.""  The Greg/Stephen hybrid played along, asking in an incredulous manner what a ""woman"" was, anyway.  I said something that I though was quite hilarious while I was dreaming.  You be the judge.  


I said, ""I believe it may have been, at one time, an acronym that has now passed into standard lexicon.""  That really got them going, and I punctuated the raucous belly laughter crying out the word ""Vestigial!""


I am slowly regaining my composure after the event.  I did put up the guest comic that Scott sent us last night, and don't forget that we'll have a strip over there on his site tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to writing that today.    


I don't really know enough about my own country to make generalizations about the different areas we have, which makes me a piss-poor bigot.  I simply don't have the lacerating turns of phrase and demeaning language apt to different areas.  I will say this, however: I am now of the impression that people from the middle of Missouri and Kansas are about the nicest people you could care to meet.  What's more, at least compared to where I live in Washington, they have no accent to speak of.  I had assumed that once I penetrated the membrane that surrounds the Northwest, physically and culturally, that I would be exposed to an alien landscape where vaguely organic creatures would communicate via scent or minute flashes of light.  As it turns out, they just have really good barbecue and look more or less like human beings.        


The San Diego comic convention is very large, but I do not know that as a social experience it can compete with something smaller.  The second slow day of the con, I mean, shit.  Gabe and I were playing Puyo Pop until somebody would come up, sometimes with their own GBA or SP, and then it was on.  I even got a chance to play some of that ""Four Swords"" mode on the new Link to the Past.  And since Brad is there to do all the commerce, we never even touch that stuff.  When you come over to our side of the table, it's all conversation about whatever the fuck you want.  We will certainly be back to that part of the country, in fact, that part specifically - human beings came from hours away, and I want to reward that.  They were so appreciative that we got out their way.  But many of these people said that they came to the con in question just to see us.  When I bought a bootleg copy of ""Hero,"" though, I saw on the bag that some of them had paid eighteen Goddamn dollars for the privilege.  If that's at San Diego, fine - that's one of the biggest, if not the biggest thing of its kind in this country.  There is a lot of shit there.  But Fuckhole's Dog And Pony Show at the Kansas City Convention center, let alone us personally, it's not worth it.  So, we'll be back.  However, the plan is just to rent out the conference room of the hotel we're staying at, buy a bunch of pop and snacks, and if you want to hang out with us or get something we're selling, that's fine.  This is something we can do anywhere, and don't think that's not the plan.         


There are apparently many, many Megatokyo fans who also read Penny Arcade, if the people we met at this convention are any indicator.  That means to me that though we may not be an exact fit thematically, hopefully the SakuraCon thing will still be alright.  In fact, I noticed in Piro's post today that he mentions ""two other well known comic guys,"" I think he might be talking about us, I don't know.  He is possibly suggesting that we might not want people to know we are going, and nothing could be further from the truth.  It is apparently SakuraCon that doesn't want people to know we're coming.  Their director of relations practically begged us to attend to the show, but even after repeated requests they haven't put us on the site.  It's perfectly fine by me, they can mention us or not - they can put our names on a password protected page in an ancient language known only to a handful of scholars.  If you're reading this, then you know where we'll be and that's the important thing.         


I want to thank Allen and Joel for picking us up from the airport, and then taking us to the con, and then to our hotel, and then coming by the next morning and taking us to the convention, and then taking us to the hotel, and then taking us to Jack Stack, and then taking us to the hotel, and then taking us to Hardee's, and then taking us to the airport.  One never knows how it will be when one meets new people, but when I got into the car and saw a d20 in a coin dish, a Third Edition Player's Handbook in the back seat, and heard Portishead's ""Dummy"" from the Stereo, I suddenly had no worries at all.

67,2003-04-01,All Apologies,"
I'm sorry I didn't put this Amplitude stuff up yesterday, but I ended up talking to Scott for a very long time on the telephone.  Then I had to adore my kitten for several hours, after which Brenna wanted to watch Igby Goes Down.  Claire Danes, I've missed you.


When we became enamored with Rez, many people suggested we try Frequency, which had come out the previous year.  Sony's broadband adapter for the PS2 comes with a demo of the game, without which I might never have gotten around to it - but immediately I understood what the fuss was about.  Rez isn't really about rhythm as such - any music that happens to occur emerges organically from play.  In Frequency, virtually every musical sound the game produces is the result of player actions.  Imagine Tempest, with the player at the mouth of a tube of sorts - each section of this tube is a track from the song, bass, drums, what have you.  By keying in increasingly complex button patterns, you slowly build an entire song.  Another thing that characterizes Frequency is a plethora of licensed music, from bands like No Doubt or Garbage, let's say.  As a general rule, I do not listen to No Doubt.  There are certainly arguments to be made for not manually constructing their songs so that they remain inaudible.  However, I find that the music choices, even from bands I'm not nuts about, still make for good gameplay.  The selections are also fairly diverse, genre-wise.  After unlocking every song the game had to offer, I spent more time in the Remix mode.  It is possible that many people did not utilize the ""remix"" type of gameplay, where you take the samples that comprise each song and create your own version, but that is the main reason I own it. 


Amplitude, Frequency's successor, is identical to the original except in those cases where it is not.


Unlike Frequency (which required a free disc to unlock its online play), Amplitude's multiplayer experience is built in and I believe includes some new game modes.  I might be wrong, I was sort of an evangelist about the first game and have been loaning it out to people so I can't compare manuals.  Instead of a rounded tube, solo play takes place on a flat line - reminiscent of a fretboard or musical staves.  Visually, the levels are imagined extremely well, with what appears to be sharper resolution, richer color, and backgrounds that react to each press of a button.  I'm not sure if I like the musical choices quite as well on the whole, but as I mentioned, the gameplay is still quite sound - and even then, I still have a handful of songs to unlock.  Remix mode is much more streamlined, with each section being mixed being given an explicit title - Chorus, Verse, that sort of thing - which is altered once by you, and then takes the place of every Chorus or Verse in the song.  There is even an online repository where players can share their remixes, which is commendable.  Playing and defeating songs unlocks not only new levels with more songs, but also new parts to build your 3D representation, or ""Freq.""  This little guy can be seen playing whatever track you're on, sometimes with a Mic, sometimes with a keyboard, playing in exact time to your input.  They also accompany and identify you online, so it's a nice way to personalize your appearance.


There are two choices about remix mode that I don't know if I like as well, though the game still comes highly recommended.


You do have less control over the way vocals work.  They're essentially pre-entered for you, rather than giving you the ability to play around with them.  Ninety-nine percent of the time, I'll bet this isn't a big deal - it was just nice to know I had the ability to change it.


There is a feature called ""Freestyle"" mode that gives you access to the Scratcher or the Axe which allow you to cut wax or generate notes, respectively.  While it looks a great deal cooler in Amplitude than it does in Frequency, I can't say I support the new Scratcher.  The new Axe, that's good!  Instead of just higher or lower pitch, you can filter the sound as well, which is much more analog in feeling and end result.  By comparison, the new Scratcher has these sort of pre-set scratching speeds that you cue up, compared to the old way, which was entirely controlled by the left stick.  The Scratcher and the Axe also seem to take place in a strange digital soundscape instead of the actual game, it doesn't get recorded on the staves, so you can't really use them as accents in a song.  By playing around with the pitch, I'm getting to the point where I can replicate the old way, but I just don't feel like these were good decisions.


Don't let that stuff scare you off, though.  Like I said, I'll bet most people never even choose Remix in the menu.  If you're looking for a challenging rhythm game that is also a lot of fun, you couldn't ask for much better than Amplitude.

There's basically two things going on in today's strip.


One, the Watch changes hands.  


Two, we've got imports of Soul Calibur 2 for the PS2 and the Cube, just to get an idea of the differences.  My own PS2 isn't modded, nor is it Japanese, so it's basically Gabe that's playing that version - but as we were discussing, it's like having an old friend back.  Other than somewhat more elaborate backgrounds, the eight-way run we don't use much, and progressive scan, this is the game we love and have loved.  The Weapon Master mode - returned from Soul Blade/Soul Edge - is truly a fancy feast, replete with treats and choice meats.  And phat beats.  Our eyes sweetly meet, discreet as we mete love's feats like John Keats.


While you can certainly play SC2 as a person who doesn't speak Japanese - I don't think anybody will find out or anything - these games take themselves fairly seriously for fighters, so story-wise there is a lot there that will be mysterious to you.  Basically I'm saying that if you bought it now, you'd just have to buy it again to grok it in fullness.            


I made use of the term ""fan service"" incorrectly on Wednesday, and I am truly sorry.  I am always seeking out lean new jargon to deploy into my lexical gumbo, and some of the best terms are specific to certain sub-cultures.  Fan Service is an Anime Enthusiast term that, I have been informed, typically amounts to panty shots or sensual depictions.  So if you didn't see the last comic because you were afraid to see Div in a thong or something, please rectify the situation. 


I know that I talked about Desert Combat quite a bit the other day, but it reveals such glittering futures that I couldn't help myself.  Desert Combat turns many of the conventions of Battlefield 1942 on their head, and to be honest, they look pretty good like that.  Whereas the original game is designed (almost without exception) to sport man to man conflicts bolstered by decisive vehicles, the theory behind Desert Combat appears to be ""Streamline The Experience And Maximize Fun.""  So, where the Anti-Tank kit in Battlefield sports a rocket launcher, in Desert Combat they sport the RL and mines.  Medics and mechanics are rolled into a single ""Support"" class, with placeable mortars (I had originally typed ""Mortarts,"" which sound delicious!).  Some tanks can even fire on artillery targets! There are a lot of very interesting decisions, but chief among them in my mind is that there are multiple vehicles that can carry three or more players.  My crew have about five people in it, good luck getting everybody where they need to go.  I feel like a flustered mom in a Lunchables commercial trying to get all these brats in a row.  In Desert Combat, there are tanks that sport five seats.  Tanks!  I believe there are helicopters that seat Six, the cargo plane - which you can spawn into and organize paratrooper raids - there's at least six in there.  The Coalition side even has varying styles of Humvee, which are true man haulers.  That is a huge deal.  The other things are just good ideas, in general - they make a person feel more useful.  But being able to crew up into hardware like that is not only more exciting, it fundamentally weights the gameplay to favor vehicle against vehicle combat.  That was excellent in TAC, and it's still excellent.     


My constant, oppressive discussion of the mod brought out others who have a favorite take on Battlefield, and I am pleased to introduce you to these projects  if you are not already fixated on them.  From our Gabriel Department, let me direct your attention to Galactic Conquest, a Star Wars themed mod whose scale is much different from any official Lucasarts offering.  From the same department, but also from others, comes the GI Joe mod whose purpose should be clear enough to all thinking men.  My vote certainly goes to Empires, which flexes Natural Selection/Allegiance/Savage style RTS/FPS gameplay.  I'm completely astounded by the ambition of this project, and if they need somebody to sit on their ass and not do anything I'm their man.   


Yesterday's torrent of mail also included a nice bit about Raven Shield, a game whose co-operative mode has been so engaging I haven't even played it against anyone yet.  You might remember my complaints about the Karma Physics implementation they use in the game, where you will shoot a guy who looks like a tough terrorist pr something and then instead of dying he will look like he'd doing yoga or some shit.  Well, look to Raven Shield Platoon for the answer - modified ""ragdoll"" files that make enemy expirations conform to the bones of the human body.  Dish up.

As today's strip illustrates, we do not have a hobby that can be discussed in polite company.  Walking near the metal detector for my flight to Kansas City, I wisely truncated a tale I had begun regarding ""hunting men.""  It really is nothing to us, it's as though we're talking about ""the game"" or what have you, but the terminology and graphic depictions we gleefully relate are actually fairly hideous to the other people in line for groceries.     


On the day you call Wednesday, and I call...  Wednesday, I mean, I call it that too, I suggested that it would require a chunk of play totaling no less than twelve hours to discuss Galactic Civilizations in any meaningful fashion with you.  Perhaps as a way to depict the engaging quality of the game, it turned out to be thirteen and a half hours.  To elaborate further, those hours were consecutive.      


The tone has clearly been set for reviews of the game:  ""This game is what Master of Orion 3 wasn't,"" they declare with the satisfaction unique to people engaged in iconoclasm.  It is what Master of Orion 3 wasn't because at the most basic level they are two different games with vastly different objectives.  Alone in the Wilderness, I maintain that MoO3 is still an excellent game.  That isn't to say that I wouldn't mind a patch.  But as a mechanism for managing a Star Empire, the granularity of the simulation is far greater than Galactic Civilizations.  What MoO3 does incorrectly is overestimate the gaming community, a flaw no patch will resolve.              


When I like a genre, and perhaps you are the same way, I become a sort of haggard street evangelist for it.  You have probably seen the evidence of this.  Galactic Civilizations, however, requires no evangelism.  The game apparently came out for IBM's OS/2 in the Mesozoic, a ray of light for the platform, and having done so years ago its creators have had a long time to think about it.  So, like Moonbase Commander, the game has essentially been examined and re-examined for a sufficient time - slow-roasting, as it were - until the final result is so tender, it simply pulls off the bone.  You travel from system to system in the ships you create, colonizing worlds and creating new technologies.  These are things that every sensible person wants to do.


The affection for Science Fiction - with its emphasis on exploration, morality, and conflict - is established throughout.  Indeed, an Enterprise-esque ""Survey Ship"" seeks out anomalies and space debris that grant incremental bonuses to your society.  Every now and then, you will be presented with some Sci-Fi scenario what will test your mettle and alter your alignment - for example, your cackling scientists have invented a way to create super-soldiers from corpses, but warriors so revived are in constant terror and agony.  Two guesses on whether or not I went with an unspeakable horde.  While the record does show that I loathe the undead, as committed as I am to that position, I'm also of the opinion that a groaning legion of walking dead is its own reward.  Alignment plays into the game mainly in subtle ways, but there are advanced technologies available to good and evil civs.


The first game I played, I won not through conflict, or technological superiority, or political maneuvers - though all of those are valid victory conditions.  There is a way to win by simply exerting and extolling your culture, which was too delicious not to try for.  Starbases can be built anywhere, and exert influence - they can be made to exert even more with a variety of modules you can add.  Of course, if they wouldn't succumb to the allure of the Space Waterpark or Space Restaurant Chain (I'm not kidding, those are real examples), my armada - also known as the Sales Force - would certainly be happy to show them merchandise from our military catalog.  I was briefly aware that, on the world of Artrus I, children playing with tiny replicas of our gleaming fleets would look up - into the purple sky of their world - to see those selfsame craft, and unaware of their terrible purpose there, feel exhilarated.


Combat, I mean, eh.  Think Civilization.  One, I mean.  Stack of ships A meets stack of ships B and combat is resolved.  Invading worlds is a bit different, in that there are items you can invest in before a conflict to soften resistance.  Combat is there to get the job done, and it does, but it's hardly the focus of the game.  Establishing hegemony is, exerting dominance in one of four completely valid victory paths.        


Galactic Civilizations succeeds on many levels, but perhaps its central achievement is making it simple to jump in and play.  It is a very easy game to recommend to people, and is a taste easily acquired.  Is it better than MoO3?  For many people, it will be.  For my part, the more turn based strategy games, the better.  I think there is more than enough room for both.    


I did not relate my Cowboy Killers saga previously because I had busied myself eradicating alien species.  Today I will describe to you as best I can what makes them so regrettable.  This is something I will do later, however, as we are supposed to see a playable version of ""Brute Force"" today and that will be my focus.  Brute Force intrigued me from the first, and I thought it had a very interesting feel at E3, but they received such poor feedback that the game has since been altered - to what extent, I have no idea.  Meditations on this topic will go up this weekend, or Monday.

I would say that visually he does kind of stick out. It's hard say though what kind of character does or doesn't fit when the game has little girls with swords and giant purple monsters with exposed pulsating hearts. I'm saying that his moves at least mesh well with the game. He PLAYS like you would expect a new SC fighter to play. More so at least in my opinion than Heihachi or Spawn. In fact I think Necrid is the character who seems most out of place. His look and moves just don't jive with the feel of SC for me.

78,2003-04-16,"Second Verse, Same As The First","
As I mentioned a few days ago, we escaped Microsoft with nearly a hundred dollars in office supplies and copies of PSO.  As I felt instinctively, the best and worst things about it are that it is still Phantasy Star Online.


We skipped out on the Cube version of PSO, even with the classic games you could upload to the GBA, as the voice options from Live seemed to be worth waiting for.  We had voice support even in the Dreamcast version, you understand, but that was because we ran as many as thirty feet of cable from the PC to connect our GVs.  You might also have seen that the Xbox version contains an offer for a keyboard adapter that plugs into the second port on the gamepad - despite their most strenuous proclamations, apparently a keyboard on the Xbox is not such an unthinkable proposition.  Interesting idea, I don't really know if I need something like that.  If games start to routinely allow USB device support of some kind I may step up.


The Diablo comparisons always come up, and I think they're valid, but I think we need another term for that style of gameplay.  ""Hack And Slash"" seems ungainly in our world of light-speed inventions, but Diablo articulated the tenets of that style of game so well that it just stuck.  So yes, like Freelancer and Harbinger, it's Space Diablo.  Twelve visually appealing classes run the gamut between shooting, hitting, and casting, differentiated by varying levels of ability in each.  Parties hit the surface in groups of four to maul Robot Cats and a host of other futuristic dangers.  If you beam down to the surface alone, hit a few boxes, and feel like you're missing what's so great about it, you are:  Phantasy Star Online is about kicking ass as a team.  Out of the hundreds of hours I've played the game, perhaps a single hour of that was by myself.  


The game is really meant to have a single person on the screen, a single player, which is why it isn't any surprise that the split screen modes are wholly unsatisfactory.  It is a nice gesture, but in practice it is not sensible.  The camera - passable, by and large, in the original - quickly becomes a nightmare world of fiends and garish harlequins in two-player.  Adding insult to injury, the two players must be together at all times - people constantly pop up to an orbital ship to purchase what are, in essence, space groceries - health, resurrections, that sort of thing.  You're also given the option to return to orbit when you die.  If you do either of these things, however, you take your friend with you - no matter what they are doing.  It becomes easier as you attain levels and abilities to raise your companions, but that is really beside the point.  In addition, I think we've been spoiled somewhat by Mechassault, which allowed you and a friend to go online from the same box and get down.  Though that would be a natural fit for Phantasy Star Online, it might have required extra work.           


What is really required is a true sequel to the original, one that makes its technical assumptions based on modern hardware specifications.  The mind reels when considering it, the feats such a game could perform.  I won't bore you with my fanciful conception of what shape these wonders might take, but I do think it is time for them to stop releasing the same game over and over again.  Not just because it is bankrupt in a moral and creative sense, but because for the life of me I can't stop buying them.        


The $8.95 monthly fee for the Hunter's License doesn't bother me as much as it used to, mostly because you can play the game quite a lot in the space of the free two months.  What's more, you'll be in a very good position after that period expires to make a reasoned decision about the game's worth to you.  If you're routinely meeting friends on there to shoot huge badgers - and people were making friends even on the DC version, with no microphone to speak of - I mean, there are scenarios where that might be a perfectly valid decision.  If this is your first time playing PSO, and you're not currently into Verant or Mythic for their monthly fees, I can see that making a lot of sense.  It is a good game, even with the warts, and even if those warts have been ported over from the original version two years ago.


I guess that's it.

A lot of people have been giving Sony Online shit about their new RTS Lords Of EverQuest, but I'm glad somebody finally had the balls to make a medieval real-time strategy game.  There's really no precedent for it, and I think this kind of initiative needs to be rewarded.  


I am not sure if you downloaded the Postal 2 Demo or not, but I kept forgetting to tell you about it even though it is on my mind at some point every day.  The reviews have been a mixed bag, I wasn't expecting it to perform all that well in that context.  The full game apparently has loading issues that squeeze all the joy from the experience of playing it, so I'm certainly not saying you should rush out and invest in it.  But this demo!  While I don't want developers to incorporate absolutely everything Running With Scissors did in it, the demo certainly exposes the ""open ended gameplay"" offered by many games to be a farce.  In Deus Ex, can you pee - I'm sure it would be Nano-Pee, in Deus Ex.  Can you pee on a transient's head until they throw up?  That's what I thought.  I didn't do that, by the way.  The transient thing.  Publicly at least, there are many, many things I didn't do in this demo. 


It hasn't gotten mentioned because of our dense con schedule, but we do indeed have a Club Gift for this month all lined up.

I have a strange gaming condition that I simply must reveal to someone. 


If I have a single excellent game - let's say, Planescape: Torment, which I am quite prepared to call the finest fantasy RPG ever created - if I have a single excellent game, I can reasonably be expected to focus on it until completion.  I can even juggle one or two with a good chance of success.  But at around three games I truly want to invest myself in - right now, let's call them Phantasy Star Online, Raven Shield, Planetside, and ""I can't say because of the NDA"" - something weird occurs.  Instead of opening Excel or something and trying to graph how many hours each game one may consume before a switch is necessitated, I'm seized by the need to save these games for some future point - perhaps to be played amidst the wreckage of civilization after a nuclear holocaust.  I mean, shit, I don't know.  I just know, like I know I'm talking to you now, that I need to stow these things away.  That doesn't mean that I don't play games - far from it.  I just have to find new ones, small ones, to take the edge off like methadone.  I found a number of great games this weekend through various sources, and should you ever require respite from X where X equals some stupid bullshit, allow me to help.



I was actually over at HomeLAN reading an interview I believe when the whole thing started.  They have a link on the right to a game called Marble Blast, which I figured for a Marble Madness clone but is instead a Monkey Ball clone.  Well, mostly.  It has a series of interesting powerups that switch up the gameplay a bit, in all it was a great way to keep my mind off famine and global conflict.  HomeLAN also had a link to Orbz, which looked cool but I was busy playing the other games I'm about to mention.  Orbz is from 21-6, whose puzzle game Cyclone ain't bad, neither.



 has cooked up a little game called Starscape that manages to combine space shooting with RPG.  Two great tastes, ""You got your shooter in my RPG, no you got your, etc.""  It may consume you, I'm just giving you fair warning.



 is, I suspect, run by foreign nationals.  Their games are also available for seditious alternative operating systems.  All is forgiven once you play their excellent shooters, derived, and then purified from classics like Robotron and Defender.  The games look and play great - I mean, well.   



 is also staffed by foreigners, strange foreigners whose pungent spices flavor a host of truly unique dishes.  They sometimes turn their hands to the production of Videogames, and God bless them for it.  Their mouth-watering Star Monkey was there for me when last I needed stimulation, and my return visit proved fruitful.  Red Ace Squadron features hot biplane on biplane action and even includes multiplayer.  The main thing I came away with was Ultra Assault, which takes the space shoot-them-up Star Monkey and does it one better.  Indeed, Ultra Assault is essentially a modern Alcon, which is a very good thing.


I also played A Tale In The Desert, but that could be a post all by itself.  Every one of these games can be played for free in their demo form, and all are extremely cheap to upgrade for full use.   


Alright, this is the last Magnetic Fields quote, I promise.  The simple fact is that once you own the album ""69 Love Songs,"" you just don't need anything else.

Gabriel has an affection with older characters we've made that, to me at least, smacks of a fascination with continuity.  Clearly, events like the recent Cardboard and Steel show that continuity can be trained and mastered - acceptable, under controlled laboratory conditions.  If it were up to him, it would be Charles this, Frank that, etc.  In short, it would be the anarchy which is his stock and trade.   


Half-Life 2, though.  That's something to sing about.  Apparently the Non-Disclosure stuff gets lifted on the 28th, and though I am very excited about what they plan to do, I don't have any interest in speculating about it.  Threads in the hundreds are commonplace on the topic, and they await you virtually everywhere else.  I'm actively trying to keep it low-key and not think about it too much, because once I start extrapolating from existing data the process takes hours to iterate.


There appeared to be interest in my discussing A Tale In The Desert, and so I will happily commit to that.  The ads are also down now, not that they would have changed what I'm about to say, I just would have felt stupid talking about it with them over there.    


To begin with, it's sort of strange how we came to be affiliated with them.  The reason I'd heard about the game to begin with was that people who read penny Arcade are constantly exposing me to things, sometimes erotically charged videos but just as often interesting independent games.  Indeed, these same readers convinced eGenesis that they should advertise on the site, and they did - without even knowing what we were.  I actually called Andy Tepper (president of the company) to talk to him about his game, and he said that he was surprised that the interest from the ad had been so good when we weren't even a games site.


""But we are,"" I said, getting a little defensive.  ""We totally are.""


""I thought you were a comic, like a comic book or strip.""


He had no idea.  He just jumped out there and spent money because his users said so.  It was money well spent, because our readers are awesome, but that is beside the point.  He just trusted them.  Trusting users is at the root of A Tale In The Desert.


The reason I called him in the first place was because I wanted to see if he was crazy.  The game is brilliant, I'll just get that out of the way right now - you can grab the client for Windows or Linux and find out for yourself, it has a free trial.  The concept for the game is preposterous, almost, and I understood immediately why they had to publish it themselves if it was going to be published at all.  The game is nothing less than a grand social experiment.  All players are attempting, simultaneously, to create a society.  There are various Disciplines to train your character in, and there are tests to prove ability in those disciplines.  Would you like an example?  


I'm trying to gain notoriety in the Arts, and the first test for me was to gather together the materials for a sculpture.  The sculpture isn't just a single model that is produced once you have the requisite stuff, here you go, there's your sculpture.  You actually construct it, look here for examples.  That's pretty cool, in my opinion - but that isn't the whole thing.  Twenty people must come and admire what you have done.  That is a big part of the way the game works, while there are may things a skilled person can accomplish on their own, everyone is playing this game together.  There are also fireworks competitions, with fireworks whose parameters you construct. 


The social element hits you the moment you start the game, because you aren't yet a citizen when you log in - you need to seek out a Mentor who can show you the basics.  I wasn't sure how that would play out, and while your own mileage may vary my mentor experience was profound.  ""Nyoka"" (of the RidgeDwellers guild, incidentally) never broke character, and while I learned the basic skills needed to play the game I was also taught about Egypt and how our legal system worked.  I even learned about cross-breeding plants to create new strains, which I think is something my mentor just tossed in for good measure.  And while I could build fairly basic machines, I could see even in the area that I logged in devices of wondrous complexity that had the capacity to speed up the chores I was even then learning to do.  The idea that technology in the game is advancing because people are discovering new technologies that can improve their lives is sort of a big idea for this genre.  


Because it's a social experience that is so player directed, I mean, I could talk about it virtually all day.  I won't, but I could.  If you play Massive games to craft things, you owe it to yourself to explore a game where that's all you do - from machines as simple as a drying rack to concepts as complex as the social order.

I tried getting a MoTW cart a few years ago from NCSX and they sent me a defective one. I returned it and they sent another defective one. I finally just got my money back. Anyway I was looking at MVS carts and happened to see this auction. See MVS games never came with real boxes. They are for an arcade machine so they just came in cardboard boxes that arcade operators would throw away as soon as they could. Now that people are collecting these games though they wanted a nice way to store them and so a guy came up with Shock Boxes. All kinds of people make inserts for these boxes, there are hundreds and hundreds of inserts and a couple years ago I even made a couple for my own collection and posted them on a few Neo fan sites.

We're thinking about a new running gag where we just get sued all the time and have to take the strip down.   


Truth be told, this one is probably safe to post in ways the Strawberry Shortcake strip was not - unless Nazis sue us too, in which case, I will declare the world and my life subjects which are beyond parody.  Though it goes counter to what myself and many people believe about the protected nature of speech in America, were we to actually go to court over the previous comic, there is no guarantee of victory.  It's not very clear cut, legally speaking.  Win or lose, though, there is a guarantee that it will take all of our time and money.  When it comes down to it, I would rather make comics and write my little newsposts than exhaust those energies grappling with a corporation that is large beyond imaginings.  Hopefully that is something we can agree on.


It is sort of a pain in the ass, though, which this strip revealed as we tried to write it.  So, can we even use the names of companies?  Well, clearly.  At least, I think.  But, what about the logo - is that fair game?  Maybe not.  I don't actually know.  Also, I don't want to run each strip by a lawyer to find out if we're talking about some kind of legal conflict, where Gabe and I have to fight lawyers and also a lion in an crumbling ancient colosseum.  But it gets more problematic.    


Have you heard that old saw where somebody says that ""children today recognize less than ten plants, but over a thousand corporate logos""?  Putting aside the fact the logos have the name of the company on them and plants typically don't, you're supposed to be just shocked by that plants/logos thing, and I've just never been able to muster the indignation over it.  Here's where it starts to get tricky:  when I want to tell people where something is, I don't tell them to look for the largest poplar, so it doesn't matter if they can recognize its tulip-shaped leaves.  I tell them to turn right at the Texaco.  Or the Pizza Pipeline.  Or Jack In The Box.  They actually determine geography.  I actually can't describe my surroundings without using these brands.            


I can hardly have thoughts without utilizing brands.  So, American McGee's creative propensities amuse us.  What would happen if he turned his dark gaze on one of those sweet girls' toys from the eighties, like Rainbow Brite or Sweet Secrets or My Little Pony?  No, I've got it:  Strawberry Shortcake.  Counting American McGee, a single train of thought requires no less than five products.  Look at Penny Arcade, for Christ's sake.  I can't even express concepts without leveraging some organization's coveted intellectual property.  In the case of the now infamous strip, it wouldn't have made sense to use anything but a commonly known product.  So now that these Goddamn characters and concepts and products are completely intrinsic to our language and thought processes, they are, in fact, inextricable, they can effectively police speech.  I'm not even trying to make a value judgement about that.  I'm simply amazed by it.

Committing time-sensitive data to a format which only distributes once a month is already a harrowing proposition - it is not overstating the case to say that this method of dissemination is behind the curve roughly five hundred years.  It certainly doesn't help that when these magazines do secure an exclusive of some kind, maintained artificially, Bob in the copy room or Bob at the printer has scans of the whole Goddamn thing available for absolutely every one, as many as three weeks before the periodical itself hits stores.       


I enjoy reading magazines very much, I read them roughly once a year after E3 when my backpack is full of promotional copies.  I am of the opinion that paper smells good, I like to scrutinize a screenshot with a furrowed brow.  I am electrified by the sexually charged ads.  But outside of the occasional excellent coverdisc - and you'll note that this only applies to console mags - I just can't see subscribing to something like this.  Gabe showed me the digital version he snagged of EGM, and while I was mightily impressed with it, the delivery mechanism is only half the problem.  What I need is a higher rate of delivery.  I need organizations with the clout of a Ziff Davis to make a magazine that might be thinner individually, but contain fresher data - two a month sounds good.  What I've been waiting for is somebody to take the reins a bit, pull off the beaten path, and cook up an honest to God gaming zine with dependable, preferably bi-monthly juice for me to digest and meditate upon.  I've got my money out, and I am waving it around madly like a sparkler.   


I spoke with Alex Rodberg (a.k.a. ""Marweas""), Sierra's ""Brand Manager"" for the Tribes franchise a couple days ago.  He - like other feisty readers - feistily brought up our strip entitled ""The (Product) Cycle"" so as to make my enthusiasm for the new Tribes game seem hypocritical.  There are two points I would like to make.


Point number one sounds like this, in English at least:  I hope that you have not been, thus far, under the impression that I am an infallible source for data of any kind.  As it turns out, I am a person who likes to play videogames a lot, as much as anybody, and my opinions are based on a number of factors - prior experience, gin, mood, whatever.  My perspective on many games remains fairly stable, but especially in the PC world where patching can wholly alter an experience, my positions are somewhat malleable.  In addition, particularly in the case of a series like Tribes in which I am very seriously invested, a certain amount of whimsy comes into play.  It's very much like relationships I have had, where one minute I am buying one of those grape ring-pops and mock-proposing in the aisle at the grocery store, and the next minute I am trying to find a way to kill her with only the contents of my pockets. 


Second of all, the entire thing was constructed in a very specific way.  Observe this quote from the post, upon which much depends:


""The only thing Vivendi's thrall race Sierra could do to get me back in the fold now would be to license Tribes out to a third party I actually trusted.""


Wow, seems sort of prescient now, doesn't it?  It's almost like I knew.  I mean, dude.


This last part isn't even a proper point:  it's that I associate very little ego with being wrong about something in gaming.  Alex was delighted that he would be able to ""prove me wrong"" in a year and a half, and I would like nothing better than for the next Tribes game to be the best.  Why wouldn't I - so I could be right?  About something I said in 2002, which can be accurately described as pre-history?  Please.          


I absolutely must direct you towards the short film series ""Strindberg and Helium,"" which I have found to be without compare - I would like to thank the mysterious ""Bill"" for making me aware of them.  Also!  I had to turn down a little Raven Shield last night with Gabe and Brad, which I did not relish doing.  In my defense, I was going to see Optimus Rhyme.

I saw over on that most mystical of boxes an interesting bit of Xbox ""ive news:


Microsoft will release Xbox Live Starter Kit Volume 2 in US on April 30, for US$49,99. The package will include 12 monthly subscription to Xbox Live, Communicator Headset, Tetris World, MechAssault (demo) and MotoGP (demo).



It's a much better package of games for most people, I'd wager - but the inclusion of Tetris Worlds is something I would like to endorse.  I'd like some quick, fun games to just bust in there and play every now and then - my secret dream is that Sega will deliver some of their classics for the service, like Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (a.k.a. Puyo Puyo) or Chu Chu Rocket, together in a single pack would be even better.  Maybe they'll throw in Ooga Booga too, I never got to play that.

Weird things kept happening this weekend.


A while ago, God only knows how long but a very long time ago, I was looking at GBA games at EB when a person recognized me.  I do not own a blue shirt like the one in the comic, nor do I look like Tycho, so maybe he checked one of the Cam Portals I am on?  In any case.  This was one of the first times anyone had just come up to me and said ""Hi"" outside of some event, so I will admit that it made me a little agitated.  I can produce a reasonable facsimile of ""personable"" virtually on demand, but I developed this weird mannerism on the spot that never really left me.  I rub the right side of my jaw with my thumb.  I don't do it all the time, just when I get tense, which is...  Most of the time.  On Friday, I'd been thinking about that encounter.  Does that guy just think I shuffle around public places like malls, rubbing my jaw with my thumb?  It made me want to do it immediately, just rub the right side of my face raw.  So when I got out of X-Men 2 - awesome, no longer review is required - there is this guy standing by the railing, I knew it was him, and I went up and said I'd been thinking about him that day and that I rarely, if ever, do a lot of rubbing on that side of my face.     


That is Bizarre Scenario #1.  


Bizarre Scenario #2:


I know a guy whose roommate knows a guy whose roommate works at Sucker Punch, which makes us practically best friends.  He was having a party I guess, on Saturday, and under ordinary circumstances maybe I would have gone willingly, but I'd been playing Planetside for three or four hours and I was sort of focused on that.  I angrily consented to Brenna's request, but I told her that if the Faro Technology Plant fell to New Conglomerate dogs, she was to blame - and she was okay with that.   It felt like a waking dream as I entered the party, seeing the guitarist from Seattle hip-hop group Optimus Rhyme, and lots of other people who obscuring my view of the liquor.  I saw a man walk through the room a couple times and look at me with what seemed like familiarity, but I was talking to the guitarist guy, and besides - it couldn't have been who I thought it was, because that would have been impossible.  Having exhausted the kitchen's meager store of intoxicants, I began to prowl the house for a fresh supply.  Parting the beaded curtain to the Soul Funk Dance Party, I saw another kitchen, containing Seagram's Dry Gin and also Monarch Vodka, which often goes by its trade name ""Poison.""  Without a mixer in sight, I poured myself a straight gin and began to seriously consider where my life had taken this turn.  The mysterious stranger who was Tim Fucking Schafer approached me then and introduced himself as such.  You might recall that I stole his yo-yo, he certainly does, but we were able to discuss other matters without returning to the Yo-Yo Issue overmuch, which I appreciated.  He talked about how it's all well and good to take three years making a game, but that he would like to leverage the artistic and development talents of a full studio to make episodic games no more than perhaps four hours in length at smaller intervals.  Of course, I support this one-hundred percent - not just because Tim Schafer is my hero, but because I think as technology improves it gets less and less feasible for teams to create games as we know them.  Tim then got out his cell phone and pretended that his ride called him, and that he had to go, which was nice because it allowed me to save face when he was essentially just ditching me.


Sunday was fairly normal.

This site is about games right?

I played the demo for Lost Kingdoms 2 over at EB the other day. The first one is on my top ten list of all time favorite games for sure. The demo for the sequel knocked me out just like I hoped it would. All the stuff I loved from the first game was there except now the battles happen in the actual environments in real time. No more random encounters that take you out of the action. All the card battles happen right there in the level. Plus there are puzzles that you can only pass by using cards. The graphics have been taken up a notch and I saw some bad ass new monsters and cards. I can’t fucking wait. The only thing that could make it better would be online play but they gotta save something for Lost Kingdoms 3 I guess. Anyway you should hit your EB and check it out.

I played the Elite Force 2 demo and I thought it rocked. I am not a huge Star Trek fan but I think that’s mostly because they have totally fucked that franchise in the ass. The guys doing Elite Force are showing a side of the Star Trek universe that is actually fresh and interesting. Personal transporter buffers that you can store weapons and equipment in. I mean, that is just cool as hell.


I played the Unreal 2 demo and it was only okay I thought. If that was designed to make me want to purchase the full version, it failed. Aside from the graphics I could have played that game 4 years ago. 

Could you do me a favor and click on our sponsors?

93,2003-05-07,Just Add H,"
Continuity Schmontinuity, that's my motto - we're switching it up.  What are we doing these days to dull the horror of sentience?  I'll tell you this much: there's a very special game we aren't playing.  As I'm sure you can imagine, Gabe doesn't play it more than I do.  


I always knew that the fundamentals of Planetside were good, but until last weekend I'd never seen it all come together - hackers supported by MAXes, delivered via Galaxy transport to areas already softened by friendly armor.  Player-directed objectives on an unprecedented scale.  The simple joy of piloting an Advanced Nanite Transport to resupply captured installations.  And the recently added Lattice - which allows you to capture bases only when they are connected to a friendly installation - means that rather than a couple guys running around nabbing undefended bases, there are active fronts that span whole continents, each side visibly making gains and taking losses on the dynamic map.  It is a comforting thing to know that a game you have had faith in from the first shaped up so well - indeed, I have but two concerns.   



The game has come a million miles, technically, since I've begun playing it.  Stability on the client has improved a very good deal, but it would be difficult to say how stability is on the servers themselves at this point, because they are no doubt under a constant state of digital manipulation.  I'm trying to say they aren't up a lot.  I'm also saying that the twentieth of May is a little too close to comfortably give the game a clean bill of health.   



It's shipping in thirteen days, and they still haven't said what the monthly charge is?  Unacceptable.  I can appreciate their position, they are attempting to associate a price with a style of game that has not heretofore been offered.  They need to cowboy up and make shit happen.  Here's something for them to think about:  their game is not worth the criminal 13 dollars a month that the standard fee in the genre has risen to.  The game is awesome, but thirteen dollars is not a good fit for the people they're trying to snare.  You're looking at five or six dollars a month, tops.  You'll get people in, and you'll keep them longer - gamers who crave the persistence of the genre might consider adding a small fee to the others they already pay.  Not nine, and under no circumstances ten.  I mean, seriously, Verant:  don't you want people to call you the good guys, at least once?


One or two humans asked me recently if we were going to Otakon.  Yes, that is true.  I'm rather looking forward to the way the initial shock wears off, leaving your whirling mind in a state capable of speaking normally to a person dressed as some sort of samurai bird.  Also, I've realized that a good deal of the discomfort at the last con was because I felt separate from the proceedings in some basic way, so I am commissioning Brenna to make me something to cosplay in.  Everything is so ridiculous as it is, me as Pikachu or something won't even register.  This convention in particular is really bulking up its Webcomic quotient - with Megatokyo, MacHall, and Mr. Madsen from Little Gamers, I think the turnout for those cats is going to be nuts.


When talking about media hub software for consoles yesterday, I mentioned Qcast Tuner for the Playstation 2.  A very robust featureset on paper, many, many readers have written in, and strangely, they all used precisely the same terminology to describe it:  ""Not Ready For Prime Time.""  It does have an inbuilt facility to update itself, but these upgrades happen only once each geological age.

Jacob just told me about the Planetside Subscription Cards, they have these for Everquest as well - if you don't have a credit card for them to take their monthly fees off of, you can just grab one of these cards at EB and do it that way.  In any case, the list price for these cards is forty bucks - same as the EQ cards, which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the fee was for one was commensurate with the fee for the other.  That is to say, $12.95.   


You can apparently just grab the game from FilePlanet now, you don't need to be a subscriber or anything.  Give it a shot with some friends and tell me that doesn't have the potential to be a great game.  Then try to imagine paying thirteen dollars a month for it.  Your mind will reel, you may want to be sitting down as you contemplate that disparity.

97,2003-05-12,This Is What I Mean,"

Dear Tycho,


I have an observation about the comic's theory that
Powerade drunk in the Matrix wouldn't refresh, as it's
virtual.


Remember that the body that is drinking it is virtual,
too. It's a computer generated illusion of the self
that's actually taking the Powerade. Thusly, since
it's virtual powerade and a virtual body, it's highly
possible Powerade is programmed to do to the illusory
body what it might do to a real body.


Let's say someone was run down in the Matrix. Their
REAL body in the power plant may not actually be run
down, but the Matrix tells them they are. So, they
drink this stuff, and the program restores whatever
bit of the program Powerade can recharge, allowing the
person to continue activities.


Then again, this all returns to the theory that, if
the real body wasn't affected by the wear, why it
would benefit from the restoration of energy in the
virtual body. It's unlikely, considering how powerful
the Matrix can be in someone's mind, that a person
with more energy might release more heat, but there's
been no evidence in any of the movies to suggest that.
So, it looks like I haven't made a push in either
direction (as I tend to).


Well, in any case, I think strategized marketecture is
only a bad thing when it is shameless or it doesn't
make us laugh.


Regards,


King Kool

99,2003-05-14,E32K3:  Northern Bounty,"
I don't know how it began exactly, but every year for the last four we've gone to see Bioware at noon on the first day.  In fact, it is the only time I can remember actually eating anything any year we come to this.  So, it is with a certain amount of excitement that we ponder this annual ritual. 


At the Nintendo party, which we were able to attend via the grace of God alone, I asked a bar technician for a Melonball.  Melonballs are delicious, and constructed as follows.


1 1/2 oz. Melon Liqueur
1 oz. Vodka, Splash of Orange Juice
Pineapple &/or Grapefruit Juice


You might be curious as to how this man constructed it.



Vodka


I tried to tell him, listen man, that shit isn't regulation.  I think there's supposed to be juice in there.  He was busy though, and honestly, by that point I wasn't in any position to argue with him - in English, or any other language.  


When I got back to the hotel, I attempted to suffocate Porkfry, and he responded by trying to poke my eye out.  So I'm having a difficult time seeing out of my left eye, but I'm too frightened to contact a medical professional.  I'm hoping that it will just feel better, magically, when I wake up tomorrow.


We got here only Tuesday, at five or so, so there are many things we have not seen first hand.  Sony announced a portable gaming machine?  Team-based, online action based on Conker's Bad Fur Day?  This is all just crazy shit I heard at the party.  Sony and MS dropped their consoles 20 bucks apiece, instead of the 50 bucks everyone - including the big retail chains - thought was virtually a given?  This is going to be a very interesting three days.


It turns out that we need to get a dedicated machine to run our store, there's just too many people that want in there for a stock solution to handle it.  I guess if you're going ot have a problem, it might as well be that one, huh?  We'll try to work out the particulars of that while we're doing other stuff down here.

I have a lot to talk about, but my eye is still bugging me and I wan't nothing more than to hold a physician recommended cold compress over it.  We do, however, have a new strip which might do with some background.


Fighting Gabriel's Talim in Soul Calibur 2 is about the most emasculating excperience I have ever had in a videogame.  He savages you, but somehow his character is able to remain adorable throughout the procedure.  It would appear that other human beings had an opportunity to experience what was until now my own private hell, because Gabe is going into the finals tomorrow to infuriate a whole new set of unfortunates.  The prize really is a Soul Edge, so you can probably understand why so much depends upon these battles. 


Anyhow, if you're down there, he'll be doing battle at 11:00 am in the Namco booth - he's entered in the PS2 tournament.  I think I've seen the Soul Edge they're giving away, it's hanging in another part of their booth.  It's got the big eye and everything.  Maybe Porkfry can go and try to poke the fucker out or something, that's kind of this thing.


Also, just by way of a reminder, we will be hanging out from twelve to two or so in Kentia Hall, we'll be there near the entrance somewhere in the vicinity of the cafeteria there.  We are harmless and will not bite you.

My apologies about the late update, we could not get networking to operate correctly.


There is an amusing story about today's sketch that Gabe will tell you later, either this weekend (the rest of which is pretty busy) or on Monday.  I'm afraid that I will tell it wrong or forget some minor detail that he'll scold me publically for, and I simply don't need that.  


I am enjoying E3 a good deal, and while I have seen some things that left me very impressed I do believe that I will wait until Monday to really collect my thoughts on this year's exhibits.  They are designed like people traps, perhaps they have a bit of crumbled castle wall or something to that effect, but ironically E3 is to my mind a singularly poor place to play and appraise games.  I want to get home, sit at my keyboard, and see what impressions remain potent afterward.  I know that it's not the up-to-the-minute coverage you are probably getting from other sites, which I reccomend you check constsantly.  Actually, it's not even as robust as it has been in previous years at Penny Arcade itself.  On the other hand, I believe that the reporting (such as it is) will be of a more lasting quality, based as it is not on an effort to be exhaustive in our coverage but to communicate things of value regarding games that have made lasting impressions.


Also, I am lazy.


If you are going to be at the show, Gabe would be angry if I did not mention that we will be in or around the Kentia Hall cafeteria from twelve noon to around two or so, which is when we have to go talk to some guy.

102,2003-05-19,Gabe's E3 Rundown,"
Gabe's baseline impressions of E3 - Best, Most Surprising, Most Disappointing - are now available.  This will be followed on Wednesday by my own answers to the same questions, with only one overlapping title.   


Obviously, since these are his picks, he's going to have more focused elaborations on them - but until he gets the microphone, I would be happy to share my own thoughts.  Final Fantasy:  Crystal Chronicles is, like Final Fantasy Tactics, a very different expression of that legendary context.  Where Final Fantasy stresses stories and systems - and Tactics stresses being awesome - Crystal Chronicles is like the brawler the RPGamer deep in your heart always wished they would make.  Indescribably beautiful characters doing battle with lavish monsters in scenes of unprecedented beauty.  Sounds pretty good, right?  Add in combination spells and spell building to a game that is chiefly about cooperative fun and you're starting to get the idea.  I had rage in my heart, unchecked rage when I heard that multiplayer would require people to use GBA's as their controllers - but it's plain now that it couldn't work any other way.  Imagine if, every time one of four people needed to fuck around in their inventory, the game stopped for everybody else.  What's more, this method allows data to be shared with one player that isn't shared with others - like a map, or secret information.  It's going to allow for some interesting ideas, where initially I thought it was just brand-mongering.  It might also be that, understand, but it isn't just that - not by a long shot.


I will talk about Full Spectrum Warrior on Wednesday.  In fact, I might talk about it rather a lot.


The N-Gage, though - he and I don't exactly agree on that.  I don't think it's going to be a success, and the reasons that have nothing to do with the GameBoy.  However, it does do some neat things, whether or not they're neat enough I guess we'll find out.  Obviously, being able to game wireless is a pretty cool feature, as GamePark 32 owners already know.  Gaming across the cell network is also available.  Gaming across the cell network with voice support is, to me, a fairly exciting proposition.  Though the orientation of the screen - taller than it is wide - was not natural to me at first, that sensation went away.  It plays MP3's, accesses webpages, it does fancy modern phone type stuff.  On the plane back from E3, I was trying to explain to Gabe that our whole group could play a game in the airplane, even across the aisle, which is something we couldn't pull off with GBA cables suspended across the thoroughfare at waist level.  I felt pretty smart, until he reminded me that it was a cell phone, and couldn't be on at all.        


Me and like two other guys enjoyed Silent Hill 2, so I won't talk about that one very much.  However, I will tell you this:  Konami isn't saying shit about Silent Hill 3's story, but the video they showed reveals a couple very important things.  First, the music is awesome, as usual.  I have a few tracks from the soundtrack that will be included, and I've been very impressed, but the title theme they played was a remarkable piece of ingenuity.  Yes, many tracks have vocals now, and though it shocks me to say it they are a welcome addition.  So, songs.  Yay.  Here's the meat:  After the video they showed, there can be no doubt that Silent Hill 3 is a continuation of the original Silent Hill.  I mean, there's Harry, there's the wheelchair, there's the baby.  I was dumbstruck.

104,2003-05-21,Tycho's E3 Rundown,"
Let me tell you of the wonders I beheld at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo.


Full Spectrum Warrior rocks the entire house.  It doesn't just get in the foyer and rock a little bit, thinking hey, that's probably fine.  It's in there with some pressure.  


It was apparently situated in the back room of THQ's own booth as well, but they also had this little alcove near one of the mail halls that drew me inexorably.  I should start by saying that putting Pandemic on practically anything will draw me inexorably, or any other way.  Now, I didn't like Star Wars enough to tolerate the Clone Wars game, particularly the portions that took place outside of vehicles - but the Conquest mode, fast action coupled with light strategy, made my heart sing.  Shit, these guys were able to take the Army Men license and make a remarkable RTS out of it.  That is a herculean act.          


But like I said, they had an alcove with some camouflage drawn over it and a banner for the game that gripped my spirit.  There was the emblem of the Army on there - had the Army chosen to fund another game?  Certainly, it wouldn't be another first-person shooter then.  Would they try to simulate squad level command?  As it turns out, yes.  That is exactly what they're doing, with a combination of intensity and tactics that I have not seen before.  I would link to their video with more vigor, but aside from a fantastic voiceover by R. Lee Ermey it doesn't do a great job of communicating this game.  


The level I saw was clearly meant to simulate street fighting in the Middle East, with a squad dropped in a small clearing by a Black Hawk.  Just to get the lingo out of the way, Full Spectrum Warrior is a real-time strategy game that takes place right down with the individual soldiers that follow your commands.  Indeed, when issuing a command, a soldier looking back at your disembodied form will receive it and then disseminate the order to the rest of the squad.  Your soldiers are not idiots.  If someone gets hurt, you don't need to tell them, ""Hey, see if Bob is okay.""  They handle that.  Checking around a corner for danger?  They're on it.  What you handle yourself is the grand scheme - directing them towards quadrants you want to suppress, moving groups to provide superior cover for each other.  It is, quite simply, the strategic game I wait for each Christmas.          


And Painkiller, I mean, Jesus.  Feel free to check out the site, if you'd like.  I was under the impression that id had run gothic environments right into the ground, and that I would never be surprised by such scenes again - that was a hasty assessment.  Add to that huge - and I mean Serious Sam, huge - bosses that not only tower over the player but have lost no apparent detail or quality in trade for that scale.  Perhaps most shocking was their deft utilization of the Havok 2.0 physics engine, which made me yell words like ""holy shit"" directly into the ear of the man giving the presentation.  The huge beast I mentioned before brings his hammer down, and the shock causes the assorted rubble of our battle to fly into the air, where it rains down on the field of play.  Indeed, this level begins with the large creature I mentioned before walking through an arch that then crumbles in the most convincing way I have ever seen, because some level designer with obsessive-compulsive disorder chose to construct the entire thing with individual bricks because he is crazy.  Don't even start me on the rock columns!  And hey, why not have a story about being God's hitman in Purgatory?  Now you're speaking my language.        


Halo 2, you know, what could I possibly say that could turn new ground on the topic.  Everything people loved already, plus dual weapons, melee combos, massive, destructible enemy ships, and urban environments.  This clipped version of what is a greater, more elaborate internal dialogue on the topic isn't meant to be an insult to Bungie.  I just don't like to duplicate the work of the entire edifice of gaming journalism when I don't have to.  I'm sure there's an article out there somewhere.  It's amazing.


I thought for a very long time about what it was at the show that disappointed me, and the only thing I could think of was my own E3 buddy poking me in the fucking eye in an epic act of betrayal.  I just don't have it in me to generate displeasure where there is none, I'm afraid.  This wasn't one of the big announcement expos, everyone knew about Half Life 2 and Halo 2 going into it, and no-one doubted that they were en route.  This was just your run of the mill, average, every day display of the titles and talent that make gaming the finest hobby in the world.

105,2003-05-23,The Buddy System,"
Gabriel briefly discussed the Buddy System on Monday, and the rules for this system are uncomplicated.  There are but three tenets:



Stay With Your Buddy



No, Seriously - Stay With Him, Otherwise, What's The Point


and



Don't Poke Your Buddy In The Eye.


As we can see, these rules are not rocket science.  They aren't even the science that governs Gogurt.  They aren't any kind of science whatsoever.  But they are apparently very difficult to grasp for some people, by which I mean Porkfry, my erstwhile E3 buddy who is known in the the north as Pork-Fry Eyebane.  He was dissatisfied with my E3 buddy performance as well, because I would spend as many as thirty minutes listening to people talk about the Pokemon version of Monopoly or a new RTS based on the Oh Boy, Oberto Beef Jerky License.  So, I suppose all's fair.  In my defense, much of the shit we looked at was - in almost every respect - off the hizzy. 


Take Crimson Skies, for instance.  Still a few months away, but already a product with indelible visual style and a feast of multiplayer options.  The combat looks like some fancy airshow even with neophytes at the yoke, because like a fighting game (for example) dashing maneuvers are triggered by very basic positions of the analog stick.  What's not invigorating about that?


And what about the special Bethesda meeting?  Who treated Porkfry right, then?  We saw the visually gripping Sea Dogs 2, by which I mean Pirates of the Caribbean.  While it does have a movie license, the events of the film don't seem to the the focus of the game - if anything, it mainly just amounts to a piratey context for the proceedings to occur.  And occur they do, I don't know if there's a screenshot out there that shows the moon on the water but you should try to find one right away, it was like an aphrodisiac and I did things in that booth to grown men that I'm not proud of.      


We also saw the Bloodmoon expansion, which you can see an ad for to your right probably, so I don't know how I should cover that.  Let's just say it was Game of Show.  


The one game Porkfry and I had a meeting of the minds on was in that very booth, actually - Call Of Cthulhu:  Dark Corners Of The Earth.  I basically freak out anytime the Mythos is mentioned, you will note that I have used it as a proper noun, which implies that it is simply better than other nouns.  If people like this first one, they have plans to follow the lineage of the main character Jack Walters in subsequent games across multiple platforms - but I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.  I do feel a bit of regret for how I behaved during the demonstration, as more legitimate journalists like my friend John Keefer were trying to write actual articles that contain actual data and I was asking questions roughly every five seconds about nothing.  I couldn't help it.  Why do the cult members holed up during a standoff with police seem to recognize the main character?  After this encounter, released from the asylum after an undetermined period, protagonist Jack Walters begins his life as an investigator of the paranormal, but dark priests and mobsters with a trace of demon heritage are making that more difficult than it could be.  


Read John's article for many interesting details, but what I liked most was that they have tried to reinforce that you as a character are a part of the proceedings - when you open things, close things, pick things up, they don't just disappear and magically reform in your inventory.  Your hand reaches out and bolts a door against intruders, let's say, or actually grips the railing on a pitching boat at sea while you try to keep from being thrown overboard.  The insanity effects - when you glimpse an unnatural creature or perhaps look down from a great height - were tasteful, and not overdone as I might have feared.  They are there to add context and did not obscure gameplay.    


I have lots more to say today about lots more stuff.  Stick around.

Anyway I decided to go ahead and make my own little video in the hopes that it might get some other people excited about doing the same thing.

109,2003-05-29,Whatever The Strip Name Is,"
I'm typing this on Thursday morning, because I'm going to that Europe thing.  I mention these things because



I want people to know where to look for my portions of my corpse in case I don't come back.



Not only that, but posting early opens me up to the possibility of anachronism.  If an alien race activates its orbital Agony Engine and humanity knows only suffering, me talking about the new Myst game won't bear the proper gravity.


It's a chance I'll have to take.


I was always a little hazy about what happened between developers 2015, now producing Men of Valor, and Infinity Ward, which is now producing Call Of Duty - but here is the condensed version.  The game Medal of Honor:  Allied Assault, which most people agreed was pretty good even with the sniper level, was developed by 2015 - and after the fact, something happened there that caused fully twenty-two people to leave and start their own company called Infinity Ward.  God only knows what, maybe it was on Fatbabies.  All I know is, when you look at what was shown for their respective titles at E3, it quickly becomes apparent that something is missing from one title that the other one has.  It would be easy to dismiss Call of Duty as another World War II first-person shooter, and the description is certainly accurate - but when you see their floor demo and watch the Stalingrad video they had sequestered away, you see the work of people who made the finest entry in that genre, and then thought, Yeah.  We can do better.


Moving on.


Uru:  Ages Beyond Myst was not really intended to have a strictly single-player portion, as I recall.  I believe it had been their intention to produce a surreal multiplayer space with cooperative puzzles from the get-go.  Someone, somewhere changed their mind on the issue and now the retail purchase will include ten ""ages"" or levels full of puzzles and large mushrooms.  I think that was probably a good move.  I spent almost an hour with this game all told, I love it to death, and it also makes me sort of sad.  Let's take those one at a time.  


So, you do get those ten Ages in the box.  Subscribers to Uru Lives - what they call their online component - will not only have the ability to play any of those single player levels with friends, but also receive a new age they can download every month.  Since we're talking about multiple players now, there is of course a fairly robust capacity to create avatars.  From a ""Personal Age,"" a sort of private home for your character, you have access to all the books you have found, as well as other things you've discovered - Treasure Pages, found elsewhere in the game, allow you to customize your Personal Age with ponds, geological phenomena, whatever.  You can share your access to new ages by holding a book open towards another character, and then following them through it.      


The multiplayer extends beyond just doing the puzzles - you do, after all, need to meet those people somewhere.  Either by typing or using the built-in voice chat, you can communicate with other humans in one of a few explicitly multiplayer areas, some public, some private.  There is a library in the gigantic main public age that contains recently unearthed linking books, you'd go there to obtain the new content.  There's a story that underpins all this stuff that you can investigate if you want to, I'm just telling you about the game.  These areas can change as you play, as time passes, and by virtue of player activity - new areas will be revealed, even in social ages you might not have expected them to. 


The game itself would be a good purchase for anyone who liked Myst - every age I've seen, including ones I wasn't supposed to see, gives one the impression that they are traversing some meticulous sculpture.  But the hordes of casual or non-gamers that made earlier Myst games so successful, those are the same people that were supposed to make The Sims Online a sure-fire proposition.  They never materialized, as far as I know.  And the hard-core gamers, the true players that prop up companies like Sony Online Entertainment with their monthly charges, I don't know that they want to subscribe to a puzzle game.  Believe me, I wish none of that were true.  Hopefully I'm wrong, and there is this huge contingent of people slavering for a surreal multiplayer puzzle experience.  As a gamer, I do have a certain amount of what you might call ""Activist Money"" to invest in games from small publishers or untried concepts.  I just wonder what the response from the larger community might be.

It's up to me to hold down the fort while Tycho is off gallivanting across Europe. I realized that this meant it was up to me to upload the comic strips at the appropriate times but it did not occur to me until just a few minutes ago that I would also need to produce a news post. It's funny, back in 1998 when we started doing this PA thing we were one of only half a dozen or so web comics. We left loonygames after Jason told us that the word fuck ""just isn't a funny word"" and we decided to make our own website. Being as we had not yet met Emma and had only the most rudimentary knowledge of HTML it amounted to some buttons on the left side and a big empty space on the right. Tycho said he didn't like having all that white space on the right and that we should do something to fill it up. I told him to figure it out and he decided to write a little post to accompany each comic strip. Originally he would write posts just long enough so that they equaled the length of the buttons on the left, making the page look more balanced. As the years went by the number of buttons on the left side of the page grew and his posts became longer and longer.  He essentially invented the web comic ""news post"" as we all know it today in an effort to make our page not look like ass. We could have just as easily centered the buttons or put a picture of a lobster over there and accomplished the same thing. Obviously I'm glad that he revolutionized the world of web comics or whatever, but its times like this when he is gone and the news post falls on my shoulders that I think how much easier this would be if I'd just put a picture of a goddamned lobster over there. 


It helps that I actually have some really exciting news to share with you all today though. We have a really cool Penny Arcade event coming up this month and we just finished finalizing all the details. Coming up on Monday, June 23rd we will be holding a Penny Arcade Soul Calibur 2 tournament at Lanwerx in Bellevue (Their website is being re done right now.). Even if you aren't into SC2 I encourage you all to come down and hang out with us. The plan is to pack Lanwerx with as many PA fans as the law will allow. So tell your friends and tell them to tell their friends. We will have SC2 running on two gorgeous 36"" televisions. The PS2 version as well as the Cube version will be available and we will have a couple of X-Arcade sticks on hand if you prefer to kick ass with one of those. You're welcome to bring your own sticks as well. Lanwerx also has a ton of gaming rigs all set up to play whatever you can imagine. You're welcome to come down and get your PC fix with Tycho or kick my ass at SC2. Hell, just come down and chat with us for a while. If you want something signed that's cool too we are there to meet you guys just as much as play games. I'm not 100% sure of the time yet, chances are Tycho and I will be there pretty much all day but the tourney probably won't start until later. There will be no cost to enter the tourney and there will be some really cool prizes provided by Kicks. If you need a map to the location you can get one here. If this turns out as cool as I think it will we might just do something like this every month.

I am in a really good mood right now. There was a good sized protest last night in Seattle and it’s all over the news today. They are running video of it on all the local news channels. There is nothing I love more than watching hippies get the shit kicked out of them by cops on TV. I’m not saying I like cops or that I think one side was right and the other wrong. Honestly I am too apathetic to care about it either way. All I know is that for me it just doesn’t get any better than some as clown in a gasmask and a pair of Birkenstocks getting a face full of pepper spray. Now that is good television. Cops even used something I had never heard of called “sting grenades” and judging by the reaction of the hippies I saw they lived up to their name. They could just show protests and animal attacks on TV 24/7 and I’d be a happy camper. Like that one lady who tried to take her picture with the polar bear and got her leg chewed off. Oh God…that one still cracks me up.

114,2003-06-04,Carroto Machine,"
There is a sort of public market right when I leave the hotel called Campo Del Fiori, which literally translated means Campo of Something.  That's not the point of the story.


I do not, generally speaking, have a high opinion of public markets.  Someone clearly must, because other people marketing publically, and I don't dislike them enough to start a movement or something so it's not a big deal.  The sort of market they have around my house can be accurately described as a sort of hippie gauntlet, where you are bufetted on all sides by odors and hacky sacks until you tell your wife you're going home.


I tell Brenna that I would rather not attend it, if it's all the same to her.  This means ""go there immediately"" through the bizarre prism she interprets my clear words, so she subjected me to it immediately.  It actually turned out sort of interesting, but I would appreciate it if that didn't get back to her.    


It appears to be a haphazard jumble of canopies and vegetables, but there is an ecosystem that governs it.  Brenna bought spices, fruit, and something I can't really describe from three separate booths, and each time she had to go to this sort of shifty character in the middle of them, all their areas were lashed to his.  I envisage him as a sort of Spice Lord whose word is law everwhere left of the meat guy.


I started to walk on my own to another part of the Campo or whatever, when a man shouted at me with a vigor that belied his advanced age.


""Carroto machine""


I stopped and stared at him.


He raised his voice, this time approaching religious fervor.


""Carroto Machine!""


Any man who can speak with such passion about a grater deserves my time, I'm sorry.  So, let's see what this Carroto Machine of his can do.


If you must know, it isn't much to look at.  It's hardly a machine at all, it's the kind of twisted metal you might find at the scene of an auto accident.  What compels him to rub, straining it against carrots, potatoes, or fish is a matter for philosophy to determine.  The state it leaves the grated object in is really quite hideous, I don't know what you would do with the results.  I bought it so I could tell you this story, mainly.  


Oh, and get this.  Instead of the change he owed me, he gave me the most ineffectual juicer.  I bought an orange at the market and endeavored to manipulate it with ""the best juicer ever,"" and it didn't juice for shit.  Let that be a lesson to you!  Never accept small pieces of plastic instead of actual money.

115,2003-06-05,Vatican City,"
In much the same way that XSN makes me wish I enjoyed sports, visiting the Vatican made me wish I was into Gods. 


MTV Cribs needs to talk to the Pope about maybe getting in there with some cameras and shit. I had heard that it was considered a city in and of itself, with its own post office and police force, but I didn't know it was surrounded by a huge wall. It is. It's actually surrounded by two walls, the outer one being comprised entirely of guys selling holy knick-knacks. It is nearly impenetrable. 


Once you get your ticket for the Vatican Museum, I think they usually expect you to follow a tour or something but we didn't really know any better. It can take quite a while if you do it right, taking in profoundly beautiful art of every variety. Near the end of the museum itself is the Sistine Chapel, which you might have heard of. Holy shit. It is in that room that they lock the, um... Cardinals (I don't really know) up without food until they pick a new Pope. It's cool, there's like a cage for them. In any case, Michaelangelo's huge fresco that covers one of the walls is only one element of a room that was so breathtaking that it left me drained as I shambled out of there. That was my definition of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel, and so when I got out of there and went around the corner I wasn't ready. 


St. Peter's Basilica practically destroyed me. 


There is an amazing square outside of it with extremely refreshing fountains. As you approach the church itself, you'll see a sign that shows people in shorts not getting in there, and people with pants getting in. They're not kidding about it, either. I'm sure their thinking goes something like this: if you want to come into God's house, you can put some fucking pants on. 


I was still in a jovial mood when I ascended the front stairs and stood before the doors, I recall the frivolity of the moment because I said it would make a good place for a LAN Party. I noticed that the wall opposite the door was actually wired CAT-5, so I was thinking a couple of switches and we'd be ready to go. 


If you can look at the Pieta - I know the accents aren't right on that word, I don't know how to produce them - if you can look at Michaelangelo's Pieta and then crack some fucking jokes, then something other human blood animates you. I kept trying to remind myself that a person made it. 


They keep bodies in that place, remains of saints and so forth, honored by gigantic statues placed above their tombs. I can't describe how still it made me. There is a statue of a seated St. Peter whose stone foot has been worn completely smooth - it looks like a hoof - by a procession of human beings long beyond numbering. Even as a person who is not really down with this sort of thing, it had a very pronounced effect on me. It is beautiful, and you can appreciate it either because it's the house of God or because human beings of tremendous talent and passion created something immortal. 


There is a room divided from the rest of the church by a curtain and a guard that is reserved for prayer only. I went in because I was there and I might as well see it, and once through the curtain I was struck as though by a physical force to kneel. I've never done anything like this, Catholics have a special kind of bench they pray on, and it is not a position natural to me so I nearly lost my balance. Where do my arms go? 


I won't inflict the particulars of my prayer on you. I just needed to tell someone what happened.

Here is the new comic, enjoy.


Those of you unfamiliar with the star of this week’s sudden and unexpected continuity would do well to check out these comics from the archive. The Fruit Fucker or Fruit Friend as he is called when children are present has always been one of our favorite characters here at the arcade. I’m glad he is finally getting his moment in the spotlight as it were.


I got a lot of mail from people who read my post yesterday in which I went into detail about my own neurosis. It appears many of you share this same defect. Some of you went on to say that my writing about my problem made you feel like you could take the steps necessary to overcome your own phobias. That’s just about the nicest thing I’ve ever read in an email. Thanks.


So the store is still not working properly but we have narrowed down the problem at least. It’s not a bandwidth problem or at least not directly. Part of the store software we are using does not appear to operate well under load and it just sort of explodes. We will be contacting the company responsible for the software tomorrow and trying to get it resolved. If it’s not one thing it’s another, right? 


You know how sometimes you go over to a friend’s house and there is some other guy there who is a friend of your friend but you don’t really know him. Then your friend has to go do something and you are left alone with this guy you only kinda know. You go through all the basic chit chat shit and then you just sort of sit there and stare at each other waiting for your friend to get back. I sort of feel like that right now. It’s like Tycho had to go do something and now you and I are sitting in his basement with nothing to say to each other.


Yeah, so…I um…I’m reading a new book. Yeah, it’s called the THE DA VINCI CODE. What’s that you say? Is it good? Oh I don’t know, I just started it.


Yup.


So…Do you know when Tycho is getting back?

The continuity continues!


I mentioned Friday that I had started reading THE DAVINCI CODE. Well as I neared the end I realized it was one of the best books I had ever read. I knew immediately that I had to get Kara to read it and so now I'm reading it over again with her. If you haven’t read it yet I highly recommend picking it up. Every five minutes I was running to my computer to look up something I had just read about just to see if it was actually true. Really Amazing stuff.


I wanted to apologize again to Club PA members who have not received their gift for last month. Tycho left me the wrong password to access the account and so He will have to send out the gift when he gets back. On a related note I am running a poll in the forums in order to pick which video game character I will draw for this months club gift. The choices are Wolverine, Nova (from Starcraft Ghost), Trinity or Talim. These are characters I have wanted to draw for a while but I could never make up my mind on who to start with. So you guys get to decide for me. Once we have a winner I’ll draw the character and Club PA members will get it at the end of the month. 


There is a really interesting look at SNK vs. Capcom over at the Magic Box that is worth checking out. The Madman also has some play test notes on his site. I’ve read as much information as I can find about this game and I’m not sure what to make of it yet. It seems like for every bit of information that makes me excited to play the game there is another tid bit that makes me question what the hell SNK is thinking. I guess I’ll just have to reserve judgment until I actually get my hands on it this summer.


In order to fill some space here a few of you suggested I mention what games I am currently playing. It’s actually kind of an odd selection right now. Believe it or not most of my time is spent on Mario Sunshine. I imported the Japanese version a month or so before the US release and played it until I could not get past the language barrier. I think I had collected about forty or so shines before I got sick of not knowing what the fuck was going on. I shelved the game and never bought the US version because I didn’t feel like playing back through all that shit I had just done. Now though, months later I suddenly had the urge to finish that game and so I grabbed a used copy at my local Software Etc. and dove back into it. It’s actually been quite a different experience playing the English version and I’m having a really good time. 


I’m also just about to wrap up Lost Kingdoms 2 which is sad. The game was fantastic though so I can’t really complain. I’d love to see the next version contain some online features, not even necessarily one on one battles against other players. A cooperative mode that let two players work together to clear insanely hard dungeons could be a real treat. Think about it, one player could focus their deck on attack cards while the other stacked their deck with helper creatures that boosted attack power or healed. Or how about two on two team card battles, where four players meet in arena type environments to do battle with each other. There are so many cool possibilities but Nintendo’s lack of interest in that goddamned INTERNET is fucking disheartening. “Sure we could allow players from all over the world to race each other in F-zero. We could link up the arcade and home machines in a way that would allow players on both systems to compete against each other head to head. There by breathing new life into the stale arcade industry while at the same time revolutionizing the concept of online games on home consoles. OR we could scrap that idea and let them plug their memory card into the arcade machines. I think the choice is obvious.” 


The only other game I’m playing right now is Soul Claibur but that’s more training really than Playing. I’m gearing up for the Penny Arcade gaming day out at Lanwerx in Bellevue this month. I need to be in tip top shape for our SC2 tournament. Check out this page for all the information if you haven’t already done so. The SC2 tourney will be at 6:00 at night I believe but we will be playing games there all day. There will be three televisions playing Soul Calibur 2 all day and a whole bunch of computers for you to get your PC gaming fix on. We will be bringing some PA loot to give away throughout the day so get the 23rd off from work and come hang out with us. It should be a fucking blast. 


The last thing for right now is just a little note just to let you know that my e-mail is a mess right now. I am working on new t-shirt and poster designs as well as about three other projects I can’t really talk about yet but are super cool. I am still reading every bit of email I get but I have gotten way behind on answering it. Just so you know, if you don’t get something back from me it’s not because I hate you. I don’t even know you. I mean, I might hate you if we were to ever meet but at the time of your correspondence to me I have no such feelings. Unless of course you are a person who I did actually meet and hated and you are mailing me to follow up on our meeting. In that case I am not mailing you back because I do hate you. So to sum up, no mail from me means there is a good chance I don’t hate you and that I am just super busy.

I feel like we know each other well enough that we can be honest with each other. I draw the pictures here at Penny Arcade. That's my job and I like to think I do it pretty well. Tycho is the one who writes the funny news posts that we have all come to enjoy so much each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Sure there will be times when I chime in with the occasional anecdote but it's always just a side dish in relation to Tycho's main post. Like any side dish it's only good when accompanied by something a bit more…shall we say substantial. I enjoy corn for example but if that was all I had to eat for two weeks I'd get sick of it pretty fast. With that in mind I have deiced that rather than ladle another pile of corn onto your plates today I would instead serve you a…uh dish from the…yeah this food metaphor is getting away from me. The gist is I'm doing a best of Tycho tribute today. Like when a sitcom runs out of ideas and they throw together a flash back episode. So without further ado I give you…Carrot Cake Soup.

Long story short, I'm getting my chicken soup on, it's Sunday afternoon, and Gabe's reading some Preacher in the Den, which is also the living room, the bathroom, and the foyer. I am interacting with pasta dough in what I think is a stern way, when I hear him say that he might like the soup better if it were, in fact, carrot cake. It hits us, hits us both, simultaneously, like a semi made out of lightning which is also a professional boxer. Carrot Cake Soup. You cube the carrot cake, some pieces have frosting and some don't, and you put a handful of these chunks into a bowl full of milk. So let's go do it. We'll do it later this week, he says. But I know that's the same as not doing it. Why not now, I say? I know a store where we can get all the stuff. You can just buy it, the way you can buy stuff in the household cleaners section and make a bomb big enough to kill God. The stuff is just lying around there and nobody's doing anything with it. It's not a crime to buy them separately, and what we do at home isn't any of their fucking business. 


I think someone might have been following us as we pulled into the parking lot, we walked toward the grocery store and tried to keep the conversation natural. We certainly didn't discuss carrot cake or the soup one might make by cutting it into cubes and swimming islands of it in cold milk, pleasure islands, like you'd see in a magazine. At the bakery counter, a woman asks if she can help me, and I'm so nervous that as I'm pointing to the carrot cake behind the glass, my finger starts to tap in Morse Code that reads: 


I AM ABOUT TO COMMIT A CRIME AGAINST GOD AND MAN STOP 


And where is Gabe with that Goddamn milk? There he is, in the self-checkout. Idiot. There's cameras all over that thing, it's like a Goddamn surveillance tree. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together. A red light flashes on, and off in my mind. At another checkstand, I pay with untraceable cash, assuring the woman that I will eat the cake by myself, without assistance from cows. I smirk. This woman has no idea that she's just sold me the trigger to a flavor gun. 
Carrot Cake Soup is like the taste of watching girls make out. It has an extraordinary power that oscillates between gentle and overwhelming, between light and dark, between pleasure and more pleasure. When it was over, I realized that I was panting. I was in possession of carnal knowledge. And I knew that, somehow, every taste beyond this point was in the service of the one that still lingered, waited, to remind me that nature has laws, and those that break them are criminals, and though they roam free enough the knowing will hold them, and keep them, until the last.

A new comic strip can be found here. 


I have some more details regarding the upcoming Penny Arcade gaming day at Lanwex on the 23rd. We still have a few spots open in the Soul Calibur 2 tournament that will take place there. If you would like to register for the tourney please contact Brad. We have around forty people already signed up and we'll be closing it off at around sixty or so. Don't feel like you have to be a pro to enter, a lot of the people who will be playing are gonna be first timers. Here are some more details on the tournament itself:


-The tournament starts at 6:00pm. 


-The tournament will be double elimination


-Rounds will be 60 seconds with 100% health


-A winner will be determined by best two out of three matches (each match consisting of best two out of three rounds)


-No console specific characters will be allowed. I.e. Spawn, Link etc.


-You are welcome to bring your own sticks and controllers. Games will be played on both the PS2 and the Gamecube. Losers bracket matches will be played on the Xbox. We will have some adaptors and sticks that will work on all the systems if you don't have your own and don't like the default controller. 


-First place winner gets an official Soul Calibur 2 Joystick for either the Xbox or Cube as well as a $10.00 gift certificate to Kicks


-Second place gets a $30.00 gift certificate to Kicks


-Third place gets a $20.00 gift certificate to kicks


-We will also be giving away Penny Arcade T-shirts, posters and other goodies throughout the day.


Now I won't actually be playing in the tournament itself since I'm sort of running the thing. Don't worry though if you really want to kick my ass at SC2 there will be plenty of time to do so before the tourney starts. Lanwerx will open at 11:00 am and we will be there in full effect until probably midnight. There will be three televisions with SC2 open for play all day before the tournament. So come early and spend the day. 


I think that's pretty much it. Like I said before tell your friends and tell them to tell their friends. I really wanna pack this Lanwerx place with gamers. If all goes well you can probably expect and event like this from PA every month.


In other news we finally have some new GBA SP skins available for purchase. I just got mine in today and they turned out really slick. So if your sick of your boring SP head over to GBA MOD and spice it up a bit.


Finally, happy birthday to my good friend Chris. Apparently on this very day some number of years ago he was born. He will no doubt be celebrating the miracle of his birth all day today with cake, balloons and from what I am told not one but two clowns. I know I didn't get an invitation or anything but that's cool cause I couldn't have made it anyway. I have to spend all afternoon crying in the bathtub and tearing up pictures of someone I thought was my fucking friend. Enjoy your party though…Judas.

A new Hookup is available. We had the opportunity to hang out with Stormy down at E3 for a while and he represents and interesting dichotomy. First of all he does not look like us. That is to say he does not look like a dork. He is tall, in good shape and fashionably dressed. I’ll admit when he first came over and introduced himself to me I was not to keen on him. He was sporting some kind of ultra fancy motorcycle jacket and a pair of sunglasses that probably cost more than my car. He exuded confidence and he reeked of testosterone. He had a look about him that made it seem like he could at any minute begin lifting weights or fucking a woman. This is not the sort of person I normally hang out with. 


But, I enjoy his articles and I decided to give him a chance. We went out to dinner that night with some friends and I got to see the other side of Stormy. Stormy the dork. He gave all of us a 20 minute lesson on the difference between all the various HDTV modes from 480i to 1080i. He talked about videogames and gadgets and even laughed at our stupid dork jokes. One of the guys with us has a pretty cool job where he sits in  a meeting room all day during E3 and tells people why their games suck and why they will never be allowed to publish them on his console. We decided to play a little game where each of us at the table would pitch him an idea for a game and he could shoot us down just like he would a real developer. Needless to say the dork level at our table exceeded the recommended daily allowance. I kept a sharp eye on Stormy to see when he would flinch. Waiting for him to roll his eyes or look as though he was bored out of his mind but it never happened. He pitched his silly game idea right along with the rest of us and laughed harder than anyone when our friend told me my idea for X-TREME AMISH BUTTER CHURNING would fail because my core demographic didn’t use electricity. 


So go check out Stormy’s latest article confident that even though it might not seem like it, he’s just as big a fucking dork as the rest of us.

Despite rather expensive efforts to the contrary, I'm no more excited about a new Tomb Raider game than I would be to fish a quarter out of a urinal.  It's not even that I have misgivings about it.  I have nothing about it.  


It's sort of funny, because if I were going to like a game now would be the time.  A couple weeks away from daily gaming has made me crave and scrape for electronic entertainment.  I tried to keep up with news when I'd make my updates, what game news there was at least - it was like gazing into a beautiful world suspended in a snowglobe.  When I left, my passions were held by Raven Shield and Rise of Nations, each trying to crowd the other out and claim supremacy.  Since I've been back, I've played only one game - Carcassone.  You might already be familiar with the board game, but it is clear after a day or so of playing it that the computer is its natural home.  It turns out that I met the product manager for the game years ago at E3, he comes over from Germany, and when I found out in a Munich sushi bar - over beer number 6 - that this was one of his projects, I began to approximate dancing.  It was really only my left pinky that committed itself to the activity.  In any case, he was able to scam me a copy and I've been playing it a lot.  


I do apologize for having been gone so long.  I did try to ameliorate this fact somewhat by posting each update, but I know that it is not exactly the same.  I have a conception of you that I write to when I sit down to do these, it's a strange amalgamation of all the mail and forum posts I've read, plus my own insecurity and a B-Movie monster, maybe Mothra.  So when I when I compose these, I always ask myself - would a furious, considerate, enthusiastic, violent moth appreciate it?  I think you know what I'm getting at.  I hope my absence has not been too much of an inconvenience.    


Brenna is constantly stealing my Hiptop to put her own stupid dayplanner shit in there, navigating her complex life of Yoga and Millinery with my phone.  I told her that she could have the color one when it came out, and this has appeased her for about four months, but she didn't understand that ""When the color Hiptop comes out"" is the same as telling a child ""When pigs fly"" or something to that effect.  It may sound superficially as though I were acquiescing, when in fact I was denying her in the most absolute way possible.  It's out now, of course.  There's a lesson to be learned here, about money, or girls, but learning lessons has never really been my thing.

122,2003-06-20,A Grave Scenario,"
Obviously, I have nothing to say regarding Gabriel's recent struggle at EB other than to offer some helpful advice.  Lord knows I'm not the man to come to when your retail resolve falters, I just buy things - I can't help it.  Even those ten dollar bins they have represent a danger to my finances that I can't even begin to describe to you.    


I had three games on my doorstep when I got home, review copies.  Maybe you'd like to know what I thought of them?       


Midtown Madness 3:  I have only brief experience with prior Midtown games, my own particular madness being of the Motocross variety.  So if they changed all the stuff people liked about it, or something, I am not the man who will redress your grievances.  Besides, I have my own grievances.  


There is quite a lot to do in the Single Player portion of the game, but I don't know what earthly force would compel a person to do it.  I mean that.  It's in there because ""you have to have a single player game,"" I understand why.  It is a roiling cauldron of poor voice acting and misery.  This is the thing:  This game does not, strictly speaking, need single player.  I know it's expected, but if you play the multiplayer even one time I don't know why you'd ever go back.  It's not like they punish you as they do in many games, putting you on some forced march through single player drudgery to access some cool cars for multiplayer.  You can play with plenty of great vehicles right away, just jump online and check out one of the six gametypes.  There's team based modes, free-for-all modes, all kinds of Goddamn modes.  We are partial to Tag or Capture the Gold around these parts.  Even better, you can join games dynamically, like we'd expect to on the PC.  It is a hell of a lot of fun.          


Brute Force:  It has received a fair bit of visual polish since I last saw it, and any issues that build had with HDTV resolutions are gone.  Other than that, it is precisely as I said last time I talked about it.  It looks good.  It is a pretty fun shoot-'em up whose co-operative play keeps it from blending into the background with all the other pretty fun shoot-'em up games.  If this fucker had Live play - and not just content download - this paragraph would read a lot different than it does.   


Inside Pitch 2003:  I traded it in for two copies of Tetris Worlds, so yeah.  I guess it's pretty good.

Just when you though I hadn't been an asshole for a while.


I don't know if you have seen this Friendster thing yet but it's pretty cool. It is basically a big network of people and it shows you how many other people you are connected too via your friends. Sort of like a big six degrees of separation game. For example through the three friends I currently have on friendster I am connected to just over 4,000 other people. Click on anyone of their pictures and it will tell you their profile and how it is that you're connected to them. You know Bob who knows Jim who knows Frank who knows Jeff, that sort of thing. Anyway, I was browsing through my ""personal network"" this morning, shocked at the sorts of people I have connections too. I suppose the purpose of all this is to make meaningful connections with other human beings. I just like to laugh at them though.

124,2003-06-23,Welcome To Here,"
You can be knocked down in Star Wars Galaxies without necessarily being out, as shown in today's strip.  Gabe was often waylaid halfway to some Godforsaken Tatooine shithole he had a mission at, waylaid by some kind of massive troll that would hit him until he fell down, and then once he groggily regained consciousness they would bop him like a field mouse in what I'm sure is a highly enjoyable game for Trolls.   


In a strip entitled ""Occupational Hazard,"" we discussed the difficulties of maintaining exclusive magazine content in the digital age, or something.  The guy pictured in the strip isn't just some imaginary entity, though - that's actually the editor of the official Xbox magazine.  I subscribed to it back when they had a really good Christmas issue, and since then the magazine has been so-so, but they made up for it this month.  Made up for it a thousand times over.          


For one thing, it's got five or six pages just on the new Splinter Cell, which made me swoon.  I hadn't heard half of this stuff, and the fact that they were able to keep it out of enemy hands - by which I mean, my hands - is pretty astounding.  They also have a bunch of stuff about the Xbox version of CounterStrike, which I had sworn to oppose as unnecessary but now I'm not sure.  It also has other things.  The crown jewel, though?  A playable demo of Gladius.


It's possible that I'm the only person who cares about this game, I rarely read writing with any vigor about it.  Though it graces the Xbox magazine's coverdisc, the game will actually see release on all consoles simultaneously, I think they're looking at mid to late August.  Essentially, the game is an answered prayer.  We're talking about a turn-based gladiatorial combat game, where powerful attacks involve small minigames to determine their effectiveness and different regions have different rules and talent to recruit.  I hardly know how to react when a company siphons out my most wonderful dreams and makes them flesh.  This demo ain't bad, either - it needs some work, as they establish before it starts up.  There are sounds and animations that are clearly not going to be in the retail release.  But it's rare that a turn-based game receives this kind of affection in the graphics department, and just seeing what I have already makes me believe that - like R. Kelly - I am capable of flight. 


Hey, I need to drive over to the gaming day at Lanwerx.  Maybe I'll see you?

I read the new Harry Potter book, all nine hundred or so pages of it, before I went to bed that day.  I got it early, passing the mailman wearing the wizards hat, pushing down a little girl.  I drove home with the book in my lap, singing a song which could not be transcribed, because it was the audible form of joy.   


I have seen it discussed - is it good?  Who cares.  It's not like you get a new Harry Potter book every day, you have to treasure this shit.  I don't slink home from the solar eclipse and be like, well, I've seen more invigorating natural phenomena.  I know now the dark depths and dizzying highs of true fandom, and don't fuck with me about this because I've got a nine hundred page hardcover in my grip.  I'll bat your head clean off and start running for first.  First what, God only knows.  I guess it all depends on where I kill you.


Shadows of Undrentide refreshes me absolutely, like a seltzer enema.  It has scoured my entire apparatus.  


Those are good things, in case you were wondering.  I stopped playing Neverwinter before I was really finished with it, because it's best played with a stable group of humans and games kept coming out that would whisk one or more of us away.  I had even uninstalled, because seeing that directory always made me mist up a little bit.  I'm really enjoying Floodgate's take on Neverwinter's tools and role-playing in general, we're trying to play through the game as the biggest assholes possible and they've given us some excellent dialogue choices.  Also, who doesn't like slaughtering kobolds.  I mean, come on.


There's another expansion set coming out later entitled Hordes Of The Underdark, but I don't think think they've said much beyond the name.  I will, of course, do whatever it takes to obtain it - but even when Neverwinter first came out, I had reservations about its graphical prowess.  I don't get nauseous when I look at it or anything, but it's a bit behind now, and I worry that Hordes will look much as this does.  It would probably be near impossible, just because of the huge catalogue of content, but I appreciate how Dark Age of Camelot expansions incrementally improve the visuals each time.  I'm just afraid that a couple years down the line people won't give it a shot on that basis, even though there's a quite enjoyable multiplayer RPG in there - to say nothing of an avalanche of player created work.        


I would talk about the Soul Calibur Tournament, because it was the best thing that has ever happened, but that was always Gabe's baby so it's his right to speak of it.  Also, we both picked up the Super Nintendo, I mean, The Game Boy Player.  Probably talk about that some on Friday.

The more Viewtiful Joe I play the more I think that the lack of save points is a real pain in the ass. You can play for a long time without ever getting the option to save. You can buy extra guys in the shop which helps but it would still be nice if they gave you more save points.  I just played for almost two hours and was not able to reach the next save point. I will be starting tomorrow again right at the beginning of the level I started today. I am willing to admit that I am probably just not very good at the game but I still think more saves would be nice.


Overall I still say the game is awesome.

128,2003-06-30,Also Known As Blackmail,"
Do not - I repeat, do not - write me about this comic.  Short of transcribing it from dictation, the strip as you see it is completely Gabriel's doing and all mail of any kind should be directed to him.  I'm the one who tries to be a good person, to see where others are coming from and to recognize each person's unique gifts.  I am the one who mediates concerns and endeavors to minimize hurt feewings.  I have indulged him in this matter because his belief that the perpetrators of the blackmail are ""hippies"" is very strong, and I thought he might explode if he were not able to fashion a response to them.  So that's that.  Ain't a bad strip, neither.


It has happened on more than one occasion recently that I have been reading an article about this or that game, and thinking ""God dammit, I had meant to talk about that.""  So, I am going to catch up.


As has been expressed many times in this space, our affection for Raven Shield actually borders on a mania.  I try to represent us online, but as a group we focus on co-op - so obviously, the upcoming Athena Sword is a source of some excitement.  When Rainbow Six 3:  Raven Shield came out, the release date for the Xbox version wasn't far behind which lead me to believe that we were talking about a fairly straight port.  Well, not entirely straight I suppose - it would have built in voice or whatever.  In any case, I felt confident that I could basically get both by buying one, and settled on the PC version because it was out.       


Here we are almost a year later, and the Xbox version never did materialize.  At E3, I found out why - because it's a completely different game.  I couldn't say if that was the original plan or not, but it's something I wholly endorse, because they're using the same heavily modified Unreal 2k3 engine found in Splinter Cell.  Now that it's out for all platforms, PC included, I feel like I can make a reference to the sort of lighting effects you might see and be reasonably sure you know what I'm talking about.  Except that now, we get effects and environments like that in a tactical first person shooter.  New levels, different story, and no planning phase that I could see.  I do recommend that you check out Gamespot's new feature on the game, as they have played it more recently than I have - they also cover the new reticle system, which I found interesting.        


I caught The Matrix Reloaded again last Saturday, only this time it was showing on Imax, which was completely astounding.  I guess Revolutions will be released in regular theaters and Imax concurrently, so deciding which to see it on seems like an easy choice.  I enjoyed the film a good deal more my second time through, though I still derived no pleasure from the interminable dance/sex scene.  It's one thing to see two human beings getting it on in a regular movie in a regular place, but when you are watching two giant beings doing something of that nature on an Imax screen it is another matter entirely.  I'm talking about thick cords of spit, the with the radius of a moist telephone pole.  Vile.


In any event, I realized as I was being subjected to this that I had not told you about The Matrix Online.  The game Enter The Matrix takes place simultaneously with Reloaded, while The Matrix Online actually takes place after the third movie - which implies that there are still battles to be waged there even after whatever resolution we get from the third film.  Indeed, they even characterize the online version as the fourth film, which is something for enthusiasts to ponder.  Combat is a bit different from other massive games, in that it uses a Rock/Paper/Scissors metaphor with elaborations.  By ""elaborations,"" I mean that different martial arts styles have bonuses to defend or defeat other styles, imparting (as they put it) sharper scissors, thicker paper, or more durable rocks.  I'm fixated on RPS, so I'm actually kind of excited to see how that plays out in multiplayer combat, which looks much as you would expect it to.  It goes without saying that style and fashion play a gigantic role, and clothing - like martial arts skills, and other secret information - form the basis of a barter economy.  Players that form clans, I was told, are essentially travelling in the same ship with the same operator.  There is no gameplay to depict the actual world, which is fine, but it's always the role of the Operator that has fascinated me about the movies - I'm not saying that they should put it in, because I am probably the only person who wants to do that.  But the ability to help out your crew in a sort of metagame where you grant buffs, information and so forth just sounds hot. 


People can most certainly orient themselves with some other side, I said machines before but that was presumptive - who knows what sides are available.  In any event, it should make for some interesting PvP.

129,2003-07-02,Garbage Is Too Kind A Word,"
My last newspost on Monday looked like this.


Just saw on VE that the Tron 2.0 multiplayer demo is out. Let's see how they did.


If you were unable to download it, or if you are just curious about my final opinion for whatever reason, just check out today's comic!  This demo is miserable trash.  In fact, were I to describe the game for any length of time, I would quickly plow through all my euphemisms for trash.  The Cycles were fine enough for an E3 demo, but as I mentioned at the time they still had a ways to go catching up to even the freeware Armagetron.  So what you have is the Gladiator Matches, which are an expression of hatred toward gamers, an epithet.  And you've got the Light Cycles that are only playable on a LAN, if there.  I've been assured by those within the project that the single player portion is quite enjoyable, but in this instance one must consider the source.  It is easy to imagine this person sending me that mail while gnawing on a human femur with a look of consternation, typing atop a pile of ribcages with a free hand. 


You may notice that the art looks a bit different in this strip, and as much as I'd like that to be a trend I won't get my wish - Gabe had to go back to Spokane for a surprise visit, and he could only bring that laptop he draws on to do the comic.  While I am the champion of Linux Weirdos and Open-Source Zealots in this context, when it comes to completely changing Penny Arcade's visual presentation until you no longer recognize it, I'm all for that.  He won't do it, out of deference to you, but I see no reason why the look of the comic should be determined forever by some earlier coordinate in his artistic development.    


Both Scotts are talking about Micropayments, so I figured, why not.


When reading about Scott McCloud's The Right Number, the new digital work he is offering for a 25 cent micropay, I was trying to resolve a Chicken and Egg problem.  Micropayments are only going to work if you, by which I mean you the consumer, like them.  But you'll only like them if there's something super compelling for you to go through the trouble of signing up.  But if there aren't a lot of consumers out there ready to flip them nickels or quarters, there's not a whole lot of impetus to go through the trouble of setting up with the system as an artist.  And even once you do, then what do you get - two bucks?  I believed that Micropayments were an invigorating concept because when I was first introduced to them, it resonated with my subconscious belief that the Internet was Man's Eden.  You can fuck with me about the exact phrasing of that, but more geeks than would care to admit it totemize the Internet in one way or another - they believe it is inherently a force for good and has a fundamentally idyllic nature.  In any case, I was like, ""Yes - this makes sense because it will further equality and the producers of artistic works will be compensated by this benevolent system.""  I am telling you, once you subtract the faith element from the equation, there isn't a whole lot left.    


Here is where I stand now.  I don't doubt that Micropayments could do magical things for people, but there are many barriers to this actually happening - barriers of a social, technical, and monetary nature.  That isn't anything more than I've said before.  The new part follows:  if you could make Micropayments work, rubbing nickels and dimes together until the friction creates a tiny bit of warmth you can treasure, then you could make any system work.  You have enough people giving you a dime to live on?  Giving you a buck, even?  Then why are you messing around with Micros?  If you have enough readers who care about your work to go through all that rigamaroll, you could succeed with any business model.  You and the Captain could make it Happen.


I see it as a model for compensation, lined up with the other models for compensation, like at the police station.  All of them cast in an unflattering light, none of them posessed of magical powers.

I just got back from Spokane this afternoon. It’s not a super long drive, only about 4 and half hours or so but it’s really ugly. When people think of Washington State my guess is they think of green trees and snow capped mountains. Well the fact is that accurately represents only about 10 percent of Washington. The other 90 percent is  ass ugly desert and farm land with nothing to look at except cows and dust clouds. 

One very cool thing about Spokane though, aside from the family I have there is that I have a friend who owns his own tattoo shop over there. Tom Morris is his name, and All American Tattoo is the name of his shop. Anyway, while we were over there Kara and I got a couple new tattoos. I finally got the Pacman arm band tattoo that Gabe sports in the comic.  I should have gotten it years ago but the fact is I rarely see Tom anymore and I don’t trust anyone else to stick me with a needle. Kara got some Kanji on both her ankles which turned out very cool and brought her total number of tattoos up to a very respectable three. 
So if you live in or around Spokane and you’re itching to get your body marked for life, I highly recommend my buddy Tom. His shop is down on Division street and if you tell him Gabe sent you he will probably give you some gum or something. 

Ladies please try and control yourselves when you see my He-Man like arms. I know my chiseled Physique is quite impressive but please remember…I’m taken.
 





I have been thinking about making my own work out tapes. “You too can have a body like this! All it takes is hours of sitting on your ass and very little exposure to direct sunlight!”  If you act now I’ll take the price down to three easy payments of $19.99 and throw in some Oreos.

The only items not packed away in boxes right now are my computer and my Gameboy. The essentials. 


As I mentioned earlier in the week Kara and I have been getting rid of a lot of stuff in preparation for the move. I am sure many of you have gone through the same purging ritual as you examine your closets and begin to calculate the trucks and manpower needed to haul your collection of shit across town. Many of you wrote in to ask what sorts of things I was discarding and suggested that perhaps I Ebay it off. The truth is 99% of the shit we got rid of was useless crap that no one would want. While it's true that I could probably sell a box of coax cable that I stole from a cable guy's truck three years ago, I'd just as soon throw it away and be done with it. 


I don't know why I decided to move at the same time we had three conventions taking place all within days of each other. If you come meet me at a con and I'm just curled up in a corner clutching my knees against my chest and mumbling something about leases, pet deposits and plane tickets to Baltimore, it's probably best to just keep walking. Maybe after I slip into a coma we can have a special ""come poke Gabe's lifeless body with a stick"" day or something.  Wouldn't that be fun!

136,2003-07-11,A Meditation On Fear,"
I avoid practitioners of medicine, automobile repair, law (with one caveat), and law enforcement.  Where Gabriel nurses an all-purpose fear of things outside his apartment - convinced the world is somehow inherently corrupt - I take a different view.  I submit that it is simply an ecology I am poorly equipped to succeed in.  It would be like putting me in close proximity to famished lions.  These are entities with immense power that roam quite freely in that region, by which I mean the world, and I make crude efforts to elude them.  Brenna called and made a Doctor's appointment for me, duplicitous harlot that she is.  These were my unedited thoughts as I eyed an industrial-sized silo of K-Y.    

Many humans would like to know what I think of Washington State's big, bad ban on sales of titles that ""depict violence against law enforcement officials.""  Well, I hadn't spoken about it because I didn't really think it would take effect - and I was right.  It's been blocked because the law itself may be unconstitutional.  Well, that's all well and good, but it would be nice if laws could be blocked because they were too dumb.   


I'm going to see if we can get the Lawyer of Doom's take on this one, because he knows the terrifying, guttural language unique to his twisted profession.  The main reason that I never feared this thing overmuch is that I don't actually think it will work.  I'm saying it won't be effective at its intended aim, this is legislators playing patty-cake and fellating themselves for rescuing another generation of lost youths.  I think that parents buy these games for their kids.  I never see a young man in a Gamestop or whatever smash his piggy bank on the counter and ask for a copy of Vice City, that's ridiculous.  And besides, I had tons of games my mother wouldn't have approved of, that is simply the way of things.  If a young gamer wants something bad enough, they'll do today what I did then - steal them.  They won't need to daisy-chain their 1541's, either.  They'll Kazaa the whole Goddamn thing, load the images as virtual disks, grab a keygen and they're golden.  Having made nice with many people who create interactive entertainment for a living, I don't condone or endorse that strategy - but we're talking about an ancient cause and effect here.  This is all parlor talk, anyhow.  I firmly believe that this moral posturing via legislation will ultimately be without profit.   


When I discovered Frequency - long after dutiful readers had tried and failed to make me aware of it - it was as though a pure light began to shine on my brain.  I mentioned at the time that it was a very exciting game, which is still true - the sequel is also quite tasty.  But it was more exciting to me conceptually, as a discrete point in the evolution of the musical instrument.  Well, maybe it's a conceptual something or other, but now I think it's a big pile of horseshit.  What's that?  Oh, it's just the future of music - and human interfaces - rushing at you so fast it could penetrate you right through your jeans.

Div wanted to touch briefly on the auctions that surround the Massively Multiplayer genre.  Who are we to disagree, really.    


Here in about three hours, I'll be heading down to the airport with Brenna, Gabe, and Kara to hit the San Diego Comic Con.  I am told by their Website that we'll be at booth 3147, which seems like a very nice booth for one to be in.  We will (no doubt) have an assortment of Penny Arcade sacraments in tow.  In any event, I deactivated my e-mail address a bit earlier today, so please hold that thought regarding my declining aptitude for Monday when I will re-activate the account and delete your mail.     


Wrapped up Shadows of Undrentide yesterday, and I am pleased to tell you that I was practically knocked unconscious by its quality.  Not the first chapter, now, which doesn't diverge from expectations in the slightest and simply delivers what we all recall from Dungeons & Dragons, which is to say, a combination of subterranean lairs and gigantic lizards.  Magical things are missing, they always are, and powerful people are too busy changing the world to handle it.  That never gets old for me, but it'll never get new either - I've done it maybe two hundred times, on and offline.  On the other hand, the second chapter seized me and never loosened its grip - though I'd heard misgivings about the length of the Undrentide expansion, you will not hear such things echoed in this space.  It is precisely the right length, hits all the right notes for an epic adventure, and delivers on some good twists that made me forget I was playing a Neverwinter Expansion at all.  Still hungry for more once it was complete, I gave Witch's Wake a shot and was again struck off balance.  I don't have time to discuss why at the moment, I'll hit you back come Monday - but if you have NWN and haven't played The Wake, don't lose another moment.  Please play it right away.


Might as well continue the Bioware Festival I've started.


I won't be able to play Knights of the Old Republic as you will, fuckers, but there's something I hadn't said yet that I wanted to make sure was entered into the record.  I saw a private show of the game in Bioware's little hovel at this year's E3, I could have chosen to see either the PC or Xbox versions and I chose to see the one that would be coming out first.  I had little faith in my ability to hold out.          


For what it's worth, Gamespot and IGN both gave the final title very high marks.  As for myself, I was  surprised at what I saw.  I'm not sure what I thought Bioware was going to do - Bioware, who with Baldur's Gate and their Infinity Engine helped to bring RPGs back to the PC.  Not by doing anything wild or crazy, but by executing on the role-playing formula with craft and precision.  They just did it right.  Obviously, based only on what they showed me I wasn't able to discern if we were talking about a game that would be good all the way through.  As I have said before, there are a combination of factors that make the Electronic Entertainment Expo a singularly poor place to judge a game.  While Star Wars:  Knights of the Old Republic is certainly unprecedented, its delivery is completely traditional.  It holds whenever possible to the d20 variant of the Star Wars pen and paper game, but fans of Bioware's other role-playing games won't be broadsided by any huge diversion from form.  Bioware is making the true, honest, clever RPGs they always did - it's just that this time, someone happened to entrust them with the most powerful license in the world.

We occasionally produce comics.


After four days dense with humans - and very little sleep during the intervening periods - I'm typing this on the way back during highly unpleasant turbulence.  While I was gone to Europe, Gabe mentioned that the way he tries to manage his crippling fear of common events is to craft a detailed plan he can execute in case of emergency.  Flying in this plane highlights the difference between our crisis strategies, because there is no plan that could encompass the breadth of airborne disaster unless your plan is to die.


My own technique is based on what I call The Simulations.  Modern life is so fraught with peril that it is best to simply accept that you will (for example) die at a stranger's hand instead of returning your videos.  I have iterated every possible outcome, implement, and location in frighteningly detailed scenarios that cover a host of weather conditions.  The idea is that it won't surprise me all that much when I encounter that ravenous, escaped jaguar.


You might ask yourself, or me for that matter, why I would require precise calculations for the lacerations of mid-air plane wreckage, particularly when the chances of expiring in this fashion are so low.  The chance of something happening has never been any comfort to me whatsoever, because that is an esoteric footnote when your airplane becomes, for a brief moment, a new star thirty-thousand feet over Portland, Oregon.  The ""chances"" are of no help at all.  I mean, think about the guy who has that rare form of butt cancer.  He's not thinking, ""Well, it's just so rare.""  Ask him if he thinks he has a lucky ass. 


William Wheaton stopped by our booth and said very nice things to us.  Brenna was mad that I did not introduce her to him, as his is the only picture still on her mirror back home.  ""Wil Wheaton came by to see you?"" she said.  ""You're nobody.""

142,2003-07-23,The Dark Thide of The Forth,"
Because Gabe's shit is all out of sorts on account of his move, I'm picking up the slack and playing enough Knights Of The Old Republic for two men.  I do this while I sip twelve year old Scotch neat.  For you, dear readers.  For you.    


You character begins to shift in appearance as their actions push them toward to the dark and light sides of the force, and it seems like that would sort of give it away to people.  I know that I tend not to trust hunched over weirdoes who cackle all the time, and I can't be the only one who doesn't find that sort of behavior comforting.


I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about the convention, or if I'm supposed to talk about Knights of the Old Republic.  Either one would work, I suppose - but since the Con is over, and I'll likely being playing KOTOR a good deal more today, I might as well wait to talk about Knights until edified by today's misadventures therein.


Someone came by the booth and asked me if there were a lot of webcomics there, and I just stared for a moment.  The answer to the question is a definitive Hell Yes.  They are everywhere, and though sometimes you may need to track them like game through the convention they almost invariably want to talk to you.  And there is wond'rous variety, as well - all the way from individual guys walking the floor handing out homemade books from their comic Pirates Cove all the way to to Super Dimensional Fortress KS-1, The Keenspot booth, which is absolutely ensconced by artists who do their work on the web.  And of course, let us not forget loose coalitions like Dumbrella or Pants Press, who pitched in as groups and secured a beachhead in that cacophonous expanse.  These are the places I went to when I would leave for a half an hour or so twice a day, because I would never be able to see anything unless I explicitly took the time to do it.  The thing is, and some people figured this out, you can actually get a very interesting cross section of the show just by standing around over where we were.  Situated by a main thoroughfare, a terrific stew of mortals would ooze by and sometimes even stop.  Someone stopped by and told me that Wil Wheaton was there, but since I was not yet a regular reader I only knew him from his work on Star Trek, which culminated in his becoming a God.  If you're going to go out, go out on top, right?   


So that night I invested some time into his site and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I know that his blogging is something like a phenomenon, but I had not really indulged myself in it until then.  He stopped by later, as we would eventually depict, and I felt like I knew him. 

If you do not already have your favorite Dumbrella sites bookmarked for quick access, I would advise you to go to their hub and select a few.  The trouble with these assholes is that I can never think of a word to describe them aside from Brilliant.  I have a few of their books right here in front of me, the ones I didn't already own in any case - John Allison's brilliant Scary Go Round collection, which Brenna chortled at the whole way back on the plane.  Of course, Robert J. Wigu's brilliant When I Grow Up collection never hurt nobody, unless they have a cracked rib and mirth causes them to suffer.  It goes without saying that Jon Rosenberg's brilliant Goats books are brilliant.  I was not yet familiar with Creatures In My Head, but I have a feeling that creator Andrew Bell simply closes his eyes, and whichever monster makes the most noise gets drawn.  Brilliantly.    


Robert Flowers continues to delight with Bob The Angry Flower, and I believe that as of right now I own all his books as well as a very informative poster.  Travis Fox, who I met in Kansas City of all places and who makes a potent impression, stopped by with the newest issue of Foxymoron.  People I had never seen before came by with issues one (excellent!) and two (also very good!) of Scurvy Dogs, and assured me that pirates were, in fact, the new monkeys.  Fine by me, mister.  I just don't want no trouble.   


I'll talk more later, about something.  Of this you may be certain.

i've got a secret vocabulary
",Tycho Brahe,,https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/07/23/
143,2003-07-25,Repeat,"
Jesus Christ.  I like writing and everything, I like it a lot.  I like writing for you.  But you are lucky indeed that I sit now before this screen, depositing words of varying length, new comic in tow, having summoned the strength to stop playing Knights Of The Old Republic.  


Sometimes I will say things like that.  ""It has been very difficult to stop playing X, yes, it has been very difficult indeed.""  This isn't like that, though.  I haven't changed clothes.  The game is supposed to have thirty to forty hours of gameplay I am told, 


(I don't mean to get all E. E. Cummings on you, but I do need to make a quick aside.  I do not subscribe to the ""More Hours Equals More Fun"" school of gaming.  For example, I was quite pleased with the original Elite Force's nine hand-tuned, no-nonsense hours of gameplay.  I do not rate a meal based on how long it takes to eat it.)


yet I'm over twenty-two hours into it and I've finished just two of the available worlds.  That means one of two things:  either I just have to wave out the window of my ship at the other worlds to complete them, or the gameplay estimates I've read are fairly conservative.  I could also be very slow I suppose, but I haven't really been fucking around.  Dark Lords don't fuck around, they have very special projects that need working on and all of them involve hurting people.  Not even for any reason.  It is as though there is always a big Hurting People competition coming up, and you would like to make the hurting seem effortless.       


Perhaps you would like to know what is so good about the game.  Well, for one thing, all voices - even alien voices - are all spoken lines.  Even lines in languages which do not exist get this treatment, and you will hear very convincing Hutts (as well as a good deal more) as you sow discord among the peoples of the Republic.  Of course, that's just one facet of an overall sound design that makes me wish I had a suite of fancy audio mechanisms to enjoy it.  You can play a very good or very bad person, like in other Bioware games, and the choices you make in this regard feel very substantial.  I am curious enough about the different characters to put them together in my party just to see how they get along, and I have been treated to some intriguing exchanges for my efforts.  The game has really expanded my thinking about Jedi in general, far more than even the prevalent Jedi Knights in the new films.  The game takes what it needs from the Star Wars d20 pen and paper system, and doesn't let it get in the way.  Most of all, I really want to know what is going to happen next.  I feel like how things turn out is completely up to me.    


It's the sort of game that, like a baby mammal, is endearing enough to make you overlook some of its annoying habits.  For example, there are apparently one male and one female in this galaxy that run after you as you go from place to place, putting on different clothing and speaking in different accents to give the impression that these worlds are populous.  I'm talking about a single model for each that you will grow extremely familiar with.  There's this green Twi'lek that really gets around too, maybe he's unemployed or something because he's got a lot of free time.  Also, I enjoy the combat now, but that was not always the case.  There are a few options you can turn on or off to create a game that is as real-time or as turn-based as you want, but the fact that characters don't have shared vision and sometimes do retarded things of their own accord keep it from being fun until you know how to keep things in line.  I could go on and on like this, all the way down the line until I suggest there should be a lollipop in the box.  But it's precisely as I said:  the game makes up for it.  There are things which could be better, but I never think about them anymore.   


In less than ten hours, I will be heading to Canada for that Necrowombicon they've got.  I've hardly recovered from San Diego, so if I appear distant when you see me up there it is because I go away sometimes.  Like the lady at the drive-thru window, I will be back shortly.  If I fall over, please prop me up against something.

it's making me nervous

144,2003-07-28,The Very Picture Of Discomfort,"
My affection for KOTOR only grew stronger while I was away, and there's no telling for certain but don't be surprised if it becomes the topic of more than one additional comic.  I got back from the Necrowombicon today around four o'clock, and played it for about ten straight hours - wrapping up another world and learning some really crazy shit.  I've got all these custom lightsabers for different tactical situations, color-coded for quick access.  If you are a droid, let's say, and you see that violet saber come out?  Let me tell you briefly what that represents.  It means I'm going to make such a mess of you that people will think Jackson Pollock had been there.


This year's Necrowombicon was excellent, better than last year, even.  It is primarily an excuse for like minded human beings to get together and do the things they would have done anyway.  Except that this time, when [HF]Invictus kills you in Desert Combat, he's just right over there so you can flip him off.  


This year saw fairly robust activity on both the LAN and gaming tables, and I tried to divide my time up evenly between them.  I learned a new game called Zombies, which was great, and there were free Legend Of The Five Rings decks available for anybody who wanted them.  For the first twenty minutes I played the game, I don't know if I have ever had less fun in my entire life.  I got the impression that the people who made the game genuinely hated me, and had invented a process by which to convert that anger into small cards which were themselves capable of hatred.  After that, you know, not so bad.  Fascinating, in fact.  It has a robust fiction that supports each game, and storylines are created at official tournaments that determine the course of that fiction.  Like Sabertooth's Warhammer 40k card game, it amounts to a strategy game that just happens to be played with cards.          


I was overjoyed to see a small group playing Shadows of Undrentide on the network, as I had assumed that the proceedings would lean toward FPS.  Lean they did, of course - this was a LAN party - but I also saw Armagetron and Rise of Nations, as well as Crafts both Star and War.  I nearly wept when I saw so many machines running Puzzle Pirates, which I had long assumed was my own private gaming reserve.  I have wanted to tell you about it for weeks, ever since E3 in fact, but they actually told me not to.  Ever since a site I linked to racked up three thousand dollars in server bills, I have tried to find out if a site even wants linking before I do it.  Regardless, there is no longer any such prohibition - now in Beta, Puzzle Pirates is founded on one of the most amazing gaming concepts I have ever heard of.  What's more, they actually seem capable of executing it.     


I wanted to get back across the border in time to, well, play Knights all day apparently, so we had to leave a bit earlier than I might have liked.  It's a pity, too, because when I went in there to say goodbye I already saw Warhammer codices laid out on one table, Axis and Allies on another, and a group of six guys already well underway on a Pen and Paper game at ten in the morning.  Ten in the morning!  The heart swells with pride.  It is good to be among your own people.

145,2003-07-30,Viva Las Vega,"
Even with a planet-a-day Kotor habit and now God Damned Mario Golf there in the Cube, the production of marbled, USDA choice comics is our chief concern.  You could say this strip was co-written by Suzanne Vega, which is even sort of true. 


Part of the reason Samurai Spirits Zero has such a hold on us is because the Samurai Shodown series contains the first games we ever played versus.  It would be fair and indeed quite accurate to say that Penny Arcade owes a great deal to the Shodowns Samurai sometimes find themselves embroiled in.  Penny Arcade also owes a great deal to Captain Immy's Pointless Audio, Broccoli Beef, and Kool-Aid, though explaining the particulars of those associations doesn't interest me - let alone you.   


As regards Mario Golf, please don't be without this game.  I had my doubts, even considering the pedigree, because I felt that modern Golf gaming had reached a new level that I wasn't ready to return from.  I don't know if you've played Tiger Woods or seen the demo of Links they had at E3, but you use the analog stick to swing the club.  Just that element - pantomiming the virtual action - adds so much to the experience and strategy of the game that I wasn't sure I'd ever want to be without it.  There's nothing like that in Mario Golf, but it's so elegant in all respects, so visually appealing, and so fucking fun the entire time to you play it I'm going to let it slide.  Gabe gets his Internet back tomorrow I believe, and where I have an interest in Golf he has more akin to a full-blown mania.  I'll let him take you into the nitty and perhaps even the gritty.      


Aside from that, which is irresistible, I'm bullish on RPG at the moment.  At the San Diego Comic Con, Atari had a booth showing a playable version of The Temple Of Elemental Evil that put a fishhook through each cornea and pulled both eyes out of my face.  I'm enjoying Kotor on the Xbox, but what it's made me do is pine for a new golden age of role-playing on the PC.  I had to stop myself from going over to the Atari booth on every break I took, just to right click on something and see the most amazing radial menu bloom from a player character.  I'm waiting for Etherlords II, which we'll see in about a week, and I downloaded that demo of Lionheart to see how Fallout's SPECIAL game mechanics would work in a fantasy setting.  I don't really know how to feel about it, and I'd appreciate hearing your opinions on the game - I've just reactivated my e-mail after a long hiatus.  It's too early to say anything conclusive about it, at any rate.  If I'd just jumped on the site here and talked about Knights of the Old Republic in the first hour of play I'd have some pretty nasty things to say about it, too. 


We're supposed to go to Microsoft today and check out Counter Strike and Crimson Skies, the latter of which I have spoken of in this very space with much passion, if not brevity.  I hope the guys we're supposed to meet still work there.

I picked up Keith’s sketchbook at the show and spent an entire night in my hotel room drooling and copying drawings right out of it in an effort to understand his process. During the sketchbook party I attended he drew me some Star Wars characters that I will soon have framed on my wall. 



I met Allen at the same Sketchbook party and we talked about web comics and the comic book industry in general for about four fucking hours. I have one of the drawings he gave me on my desktop at work and above it I wrote “LINE” and “SHAPE”.

I have been getting a bit of email regarding the latest Movie Comics “controversy” and I figured I should comment on it here just to clear some things up.


So Mr. Furious apparently created a new T-shirt design that has his characters dressed up as Gabe and Tycho. I guess he gets a lot of shit from people since his style looks a lot like mine and maybe this shirt is a little joke about that or something. Anyway, he says that we contacted him and that now he’s not gonna make the shirt because he doesn’t want any trouble. Honestly we do not care if he makes the shirt. He is just trying to drum up some publicity by creating a controversy that never existed. 


It’s true that he has talked to Tycho, Brad and I about the shirt. Tycho told him to go ahead and make it, that there isn’t anything we could do. Brad sent him a mail and said he had a question about the design and asked Furious to get back to him, he just wanted to know if it was a joke or not. I told him to make the damn shirt. Does this sound like controversy? Does this sound like we want him to stop?


Here is the deal, contrary to what Furious might think we do not care about MC. Even if we really did want to stop him from making the shirt that would require us to spend money on some legal bullshit that we may or may not win. Keep in mind we are the same artists who get ass reamed by lawyers at least once a month. Does that honestly sound like something we would do? 


If furious thinks that is a clever design or one that his fans will enjoy and purchase then I think he should go ahead and make it. I appreciate all the mail I am getting from PA fans suggesting we do something to stop him but it just isn’t that big of a deal.

149,2003-08-04,Perhaps the Biggest Dorks Ever,"
We have a lot of ground to cover today, so we'd best get started.


Some of them are funny, some of them are annoying, and some of them simply stem from extremely accurate rule interpretations - but Knights of the Old Republic pack the mad bugs.  In our effort to relate some portion of that tale we somehow combined Star Trek and Star Wars, quite inadvertently, and originally considered changing it.  Now, though, if someone asks us for incontrovertible proof that we are massive dorks, we can simply give them that URL.  They would have a difficult time controverting that.  


The new Tron 2.0 demo is scrumptious.  It's at Gamespot, at least, that's where I got it - but you might need to be a subscriber, and unless you crave Greg Kasavin you might not be.  There's a demo that comes with Computer Games Gamazine, but one of the editors just wrote me and said it's not the newest stuff.  In any case, my experience with this demo (based as it is on final code) is a good deal different from my initial take.  For one thing, it includes a portion of the Single Player, whose stylish representations and unique take on First Person Shooters I enjoyed quite a bit.  To explain what I mean about ""unique takes,"" let's make it clear that you are able to search enemy remains for upgrades to your own program - and these upgrades can do anything from make you jump higher to muffling the sound of your footsteps.  There are also new weapons, as well as upgrades for weapons, which move from Alpha to Beta to Gold state and improve at each level.  You must make the programs you want to use fit into the available memory, each one takes a certain number of slots and you only get so many based on the level - if I have read earlier previews right, on levels that take place in a PDA or something you will have less memory to work with.  Also, these programs can be corrupted, which means you need to clean them with Anti-Virus routines...  They have actively tried to integrate the setting where lip service would probably have sufficed for most people.  Also, I want to lick the people responsible for sound.       


The Disc Arena mode in the earlier demo was highly unsatisfying to me, as you might recall.  The disc and controls did not reach the levels of responsiveness I required to feel like a digital bad-ass, even on low ping servers - my hand would make a throwing motion, and the disc would appear at some point in front of me.  The range of the combat kept it from feeling intimate or dangerous.  Also, virally infected sectors such as the one in the previous demo were certainly beautiful to look at, but they were not canonical - yet.  The new multiplayer demo is responsive, clean, and plays better than the old one even at pings twice what I had before.  It includes an arena that feels a bit more true to the ones in the film, and I also prefer the layout of the destructible rings that make up the playfield.  I haven't tried the Light Cycles online yet, but they tell you right there it's not supported for Internet play so I could hardly bitch about that and be taken seriously.  In any case, find this demo and play it until you beat it.     


At HalfLife2d.com, you can find a new gameplay video for this sidescroller based on the Half-Life series.  The video has what looks to be some two dimensional parodies of things we've seen in HL2 preview videos, among other things.  

 
Last thing:  I originally mistook Legends:  Coming Of A New Age for another mod, but hey, what do you do.  Legends looks to be recreate the speed of Tribes for the Torque engine.  Still a very nice idea!

150,2003-08-06,A Common Misconception,"
Laser Squad Nemesis is a play by mail tactical game that isn't just like X-Com, it's made by the actual X-Com guys.  Used to be that I couldn't go a day without Porkfry sending me the first round - you can play a few free games if a subscriber challenges you, though you are limited in what armies you can select - and we would while away the afternoons in frenzied bids for galactic supremacy.  I never knew they were planning on a retail release, as everyone is just downloading it now and that seems to work fine.  But there you have it.  We have produced a comic to commemorate the release of this game, or perhaps some other game.


I saw the new version of the Army game when I was at E3, and subsequently failed to mention it because I had been thinking about it a lot.  I don't know how that happens, but sometimes when things are very present in my mind I assume that they are also visible or something.  In any case, it is some pretty hot shit.  The version I'm talking about here is the 1.9, which was leaked, and currently unplayable online.  If you had held off on trying it before, either because you heard that portions of the gameplay experience were a bit raw or you were afraid that it would sign you up for the armed forces in the background, this might be a good time to try it.  


Much of what I saw of it at the Expo was just tuning the experience somewhat - visually improved menu, music, the presentation was much cleaner.  We're also talking about considerably more elaborate maps and player models, as time has passed from the initial launch it appears they've decided to raise the stakes a bit hardware-wise.  Version 1.9 also adds the Combat Medic, and with it a fundamental rules change - as I understood it, a percentage of the damage dealt by a bullet can be treated by a medical officer, and left untreated injured tend to get worse.  To be a medic, though, required that you attend courses.  Training for new classes gets more elaborate each time they introduce one, and this might be the fanciest yet - you enter a Military Hospital and actually attend class and take tests.  I'm not saying that taking tests is fun or whatever, but it's an interesting way to satisfy the game's mission.     


It's got Punkbuster now, and eventually you'll see Special Forces troops with the ability to customize their weapons with via five distinct hardpoints - flashlights that can blind players, laser sights, paintjobs, all sorts of things.  Looked great when I saw it, I think they're looking at Fall for that stuff.  The current version, 1.7, is now available for Mac as well - but I'm fairly late on that news, as usual.  It also looks like you have to pay for it.     


Some humans became very agitated when we said that Knights of the Old Republic had bugs on Monday.  Well, it does have bugs, bugs that might make you skip planets or wreck your saves.  I'm not being unreasonable by mentioning them.  I still played it eight more hours yesterday, and I'm going play it some more today.  There are people who play the game straight through with no anomalies.  It just seemed like it was better than you know about them - and some of their possible solutions - than not.

151,2003-08-08,The Nick Of Time,"
Chaos Legion, a stylish action game supposedly of the formula Devil May Cry plus RPG equals, is garnering reviews that look more like especially cruel prison initiations.  Gabriel was lured in by Legion's stylish cape guy and promises of fast-paced action, and was instead treated to the gaming equivalent of leftovers - incomplete concepts of specious origin married to some tepid, room temperature gameplay.  In any event, the nicest thing you can say about it is that the disc didn't cut your finger.  And, ever the guardian of the unsuspecting gamer, Gabriel was forced to take drastic measures at the EB up in Lynnwood.   


There's two things you need to be playing today, so to bring you to this state sooner let's dispense with the usual stock tips and Cajun recipes and get right to the heart of the matter.  


You do, of course, recall the exquisite treat known as Stair Dismount - the game where your objective it to inflict maximum damage on a man as he falls down a flight of stairs.  Are you aware, then, of Truck Dismount, where this same man is again set upon by combinations of trucks, ramps, and unyielding walls, in combinations limited only by your imagination?  This seems to me a fine way to invest one's Friday, hurting people, and then hurting them again.   


Speaking of hurting people, EvilAvatar has a list of places you can get the English XIII Demo from.  And you do want to get it.  I hardly know how to respond to the crafty, clever ways they have blended comic book narrative and first-person gameplay.  I initially thought of it as just their unique conceit, like Red Faction lets you blow up walls sometimes, and then makes you suffer through the rest of the game for the privilege of doing so.  No, I think some of the concepts in XIII are actually staggering in their revolutionary simplicity.  Seeing sound effects (as well as hearing them) helps you orient yourself to this virtual environment.  Something the player needs to know about?  It highlights things in comic panels suspended over your field of vision, and they leave when they're no longer relevant.  Screens are no way to see the way this game operates, individual shots just make it look sort of bland to me.  You have to see it moving to understand just how well they have succeeded in making their ambitious visual design viable in first person - not only aesthetically, but functionally.           


I watched The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which I felt would be the final test of my newfound ability to enjoy movies - regardless of conceptual sideshows like quality.  As it turns out, I can.  I can, with the help of the revolutionary system I call 3D.


a)  Drink Many, Many Bombay Tonics
b)  Dispense With Your Affection For Canon
c)  Deny That There Is A Rational God Which Regulates The Quality Of Human Endeavor

People had been asking Storm Shadow to cover the basics of a good sound setup in his next Hook Up, and he was able to provide just that.  How he was able to fit this into his dense schedule of globetrotting erotic adventure is beyond me.

152,2003-08-11,Send This To Your Local Paper,"
More than a few humans sent in the following political cartoon, such as it is.  It's entirely possible that we will receive a request to remove that cartoon from our site today, and if that should occur, just look down into the toilet when you finish for a reasonable facsimile of the work in question.  We had another cartoon about Freaky Flyers all written up, but once we'd both seen this Dr. Frankenstein bullshit we had to do something in that vein.  So, here's our take on the issue of videogame violence as we see it, and it comes with homework:  submit the cartoon to the editorial section of your local paper.  Go ahead, I can wait.   


The cartoon is wrong on many levels - the entire release list for 2003 consists of a good deal more than just a Postal game and Vice City, Frankenstein's actual equipment for perverting the young would appear more baroque, etc.  But I find it particularly jarring that he's chosen to riff on the First Amendment, suggesting that it is somehow a perversion of its mission to communicate things and be protected.     


I guess you could say it's something of a sore subject for me.


He should try producing a work that does more that tweak the nose of power, something that asks serious questions of it, something that combines cleverness and art into a weapon and see how far it gets with his editor.  Then, perhaps the First Amendment won't be some ethereal concept worthy of ridicule when it protects other people and something tangible and obvious when it governs his own creative output.           


Here are the facts of the matter, for old people who can't be bothered to inform themselves:  Videogames are a form of entertainment, like other forms of entertainment.  It's shocking that I would have to reiterate that, but apparently there is a deep idiocy setting in out there, and I need to try and get this in before it hardens completely.  Much the same way that our society has determined that a rated R movie contains material that is unacceptable for our tender young, so too have we determined that videogames rated M include things we might not like young children to see.  Assuming that videogames did transform respectful youngsters into slavering sharpshooter rapists, it's not a point I'll grant in any other context, but let's say it's true:  Where did they get the (then) two or three hundred dollar Playstation 2 to run this toxic software?  The computer with the 3D hardware?  The broadband connection?  I really want to know what societal dementia persists in letting parents off the hook for this shit.

154,2003-08-13,It's Fun To Meet New People,"
Before we were derailed by David Horsey, we had it as our intention to detail what a criminal act it is that Freaky Flyers lacks Internet play.  Oh, I know what you're saying.  ""Freaky Flyers...""  You knit your brow.  You've heard that Midway was doing some sort of flying race game, and you have scrupulously avoided any contact with it for fear that its mediocrity might somehow be virulent.  I bet Gabe that it would be terrible, and it wasn't, so now I have to fuck a dog.  It was a stupid bet, and I should never have agreed to it.  But I had no reason to believe that an off-brand flying racer would be enjoyable, or that the parts they meant to be funny actually would be.                    


When I smarted off about Counter-Strike a few posts ago, wondering aloud why people would still play it and raising dark questions about their heritage, it was (of course) only a matter of time before I began playing it again nightly.  I don't know how I expect to be an Internet demagogue when I consistently fail to take my own advice.  I've lost my Half-Life again, and I've bought it more times than I can remember, so I wasn't going to do that.  Valve's ""Steam"" content delivery service has CS 1.6 on there, and I had been meaning to check it out anyway, so hey.  I'd used it before, a while ago, and it appears to have matured a bit since then.  It's nothing you have to pay for at this point - but I'm swiping my card feverishly at the air in anticipation.  The concept of buying games that are delivered to me digitally while I chew the ice from my Whiskey Sour is something I have great passion for, and I have never shared the mania that associates a physical object with my Game Experience.  I was overjoyed by Stardock's brilliant ""Stardock Central"" app, which allowed me to download their latest games with such elegance that I check it daily for updates.  Also, I believe that it emits an inaudible tone that subverts my will.  In any case, try out Steam if you never did, and if you've been out of CS for a few years like I have, just jump back in with both feet.  It's like riding a bike while you fire a submachine gun at international police.


I've been sort of sick of Internet Explorer for a while, so I've been spinning the chamber in a deadly game of Browser Roulette.  I spent some time with the newest Mozilla, which was fine, though I always did prefer the lighter Firebird.  Went back to Opera for a bit, and found it well, but the grim realities of IE's browser hegemony began to set in when I tried to use services like BuyMusic, which I found to be excellent, but if you're not using you some Internet Explorer they're simply not interested in your business.  That's when it basically hit me that I didn't want a new browser, not really, I just wanted IE to act more like a piece of modern fucking software.  You know, block pop-ups and browse in tabs and do some year 2003 type shit.  All I can say is Thank God For Avant Browser, which has brought some welcome sanity to my Internet usage.  It's essentially a shell for IE, so you get all the compatibility you miss out on with other software - without sacrificing the sensible additions that browser evolution has wrought.        


I certainly hope you haven't mailed me the last couple days, because my Internet only just came back on - if you've tried to correspond, you probably got a whole lot of nothing.

155,2003-08-15,From Another Human Being,"
I just wanted to remind people that they were reading Penny Arcade.


We spent most of the day playing Final Fantasy:  Crystal Chronicles, which is to say, we spent most of the day learning to play it.  As an import genre, bringing an RPG over from Japan is a fool's errand.  Plunging into menu trees four deep, and then realizing your adventures have somehow produced a carrot is a unique experience that combines ordinary thought with a sort of contorted brain yoga.  It also raises troubling questions about vegetables.  However, as I've stated before, even the most rudimentary successes with an alien interface give one the impression that they are a magician.


It was a combination of Gabriel's bottomless affection for the title and Travis from Videogame Depot's timely execution that brought it to us, and I am pleased to say that we can now drop things from our inventory with a very high rate of success.  We can also filet a goblin.  We can even filet and cook a goblin simultaneously, by combining a ""strong attack"" and fire magic.  Spells and special abilities are targeted in the playfield by a circle that corresponds to the player's color, and two or more players may combine the effects of their action by properly timing their attacks.  It works in ways you'd expect, like multiple fire or cure spells creating a more enhanced version of the spell.  It also works in ways you don't expect, like combining different attack spells and producing another type of damage altogether.  It's fun to experiment, and it's even more fun to land such unstoppable energies on an evil rodent.  You can read about a few such combinations in the only GameFAQ available for the game, as those are pretty much the same ones we came up with.


The game is beautiful, and any attempt to capture that here will either fail outright or venture perilously close to poetry.  With four races and a handful of outfits for each gender, each character is easy to identify and brims with unique animation.  Even just looking at the menu makes me want to sing a song.  It really is a jewel for the system, something that shows what the machine is capable of when someone takes it seriously.  They're saying February for the US release, I think we might have mentioned that before, presumably for the prodigious volume of localization they need to do.  There's a lot of stuff I didn't mention, like how you have to choose your parents' profession or how you can spraypaint moogles.  As much as I'd like to shake you by the shoulders and reveal all, I'd rather leave much of the mystery in reserve.


Since we've both beaten Kotor now - with opposite Force polarities, of course - the portion of our history that was dense with comment on the title is (probably) over.  By way of a final word on the topic, I just want to say that Bioware has not only outdone themselves with the game, they've probably outdone Lucas.  They don't make me regret my nostalgia for the Universe, rather, they reward me for it and remind me why I invested myself so in the first place.

156,2003-08-18,LAND OF THE RISING FUN!,"
As long as we are talking about import games I should mention the other one I just got. Dragon drive is the latest offering from Bandai and like most of their other games it goes along with a card game as well as an animated series. The game comes with two disks, the first one being an actual cartoon. At first I thought I was just watching a really fucking long intro. After about a half an hour I realized I was watching a goddamned movie. From what I gathered your main character plays a virtual reality card game called Dragon Drive. Players sit inside VR machines and do battle with their cards in a virtual world. Okay whatever.


The game itself is a shooter with a couple different kinds of levels. You’ll either be flying around in a free roaming 3D environment or something more along the lines of space harrier where you fly forward and shoot anything that pops up. The later style of level includes a lock on system similar to REZ giving you the ability to target multiple enemies and then attack them all at once. Throughout the levels you’ll find bonus cards that will give your dragon various power ups. You can hold as many as four of these at a time and select the one you want to activate with the directional pad. 


The game is cell shaded and looks decent. It certainly won’t be winning any awards for it’s visuals but they get the job done. The actual dragon designs are pretty sweet  and the enemies and bosses you’ll go up against are equally cool. The environments are for the most part pretty bland. The problem is that most people are comparing this game to Panzer Dragoon Orta. Those are some tough shoes to fill. In the end Dragon Drive doesn’t look as good, or play as well as PDO. 


You will be hard pressed to find any English anywhere in this title. It’s nothing but Japanese as far as the eye can see. It’s still easy enough to navigate the menus and once you’re in the game it’s a pretty straight forward shooter. I do feel like I might be missing some of the intricacies of the card battle system though. It appears as though cards can gain XP but I don’t really understand that part. There is also a card collection side of the game but without reading japanese I'm pretty lost. On a side note the game works perfectly with the Freeloader.


Overall I’d say unless you are a fan of the anime or the card game there is really not much reason to import this one. On the other hand fans of the series will probably get a kick out of it. For everyone else though you could probably buy a Saturn and a copy of Panzer Dragoon and have a much better time.

157,2003-08-20,I Hate The Stupid Phantom,"
We have been called upon to comment on that stupid Phantom console once already, but with a glitzy new video available at the machine's homepage readers let us know that our services were required.  Still no actual pictures of the device, just that same case render which makes the Xbox look svelte by comparison.  Then there's the matter of the specifications they claim, the best of everything basically, which makes it the Fable of the console world - just say with enthusiasm that it has whatever a person asks about.  


""Yes, hello - can you make jams and jellies in Fable?""  


""Oh yes, er, quite right - by breeding any two of over a million digital berries.""       


I keep an awfully close eye on Nival Interactive, because they've made a habit of surprising me.  Whether it's an online card game with a Heroes of Might And Magic-style world overlay or a World War II RTS that calculates its combat with old-school, wargamer depth, they seem committed to genres or takes on genres that I felt were heretofore the domain of my private fantasies.    


Take Silent Storm, for instance.


Silent Storm should not be able to exist in the world outside my own skull, like a fragile, subterranean mushroom that cannot bear unmitigated sunlight.  It bolsters me like an elixir.  The feature list reads like a transcript from some gamer sex line, a turn-based World War 2 where activities are meted out according to Action Points, and you construct teams based on differing professions and nationalities that improve according to RPG conventions.  It calculates real hit locations, as well as bullet deflection and penetration through materials, in fully destructible, interactive environments.  I can almost feel warm breath on my earlobe.  The game makes me want to abandon my life and splish shoeless in a stream born of melting winter snow.  I cup my hands under the water and am suddenly aware that the mountain, the stream, and myself share certain elements of composition.  Are the mountain and the stream aware of this?  I lock eyes with a bounding fawn and detect what I believe to be recognition.  Love is audible and each life produces a resonance distinguishable from all other lives.  


This is the way I feel when I play just the Russian Demo of Silent Storm, which before yesterday didn't even have an American publisher.  There's also a video of the game available on the same page.  I want to thank Sean of the now defunct Force Monkeys and the soon to be funct Indomitable Mr. Stick for letting me know about the demo as it has inspired impromptu poems from the moment I installed it.  


I mentioned Savage on Monday, and I'll probably mention it again with the release date so close - but, as unique as its combination of RTS and action gameplay is, the game that did it first looks to be set for a resurgence.  If there is another example of the players taking the welfare of a game and making it their personal responsibility, well, I'd love to hear about it, because that's exactly what's going on.  Long ago having been orphaned by Microsoft itself, Allegiance - a game I have buoyed with praise as being ahead of its time, too beautiful to live, etc. - is in the process of receiving new cheat protections and authentication systems, all provided by the community that stuck with the game.  If you remember having played it a while ago, or if you found it in the cheapie bin and just had a good feeling about it, here is an opportunity to play a game that did nothing compromise its vision.  There's still nothing that does what it did.

I have been meaning to talk about Crystal Chronicles for a while now but I’ve just been playing it instead. I took a break to check out some forums and get some tips when I saw this post:

Dont call me a newb i just wanna know.


So, you need 4 GBA's to play multiplayer? Because if thats that case, nintendo and square have just made the biggest mistake ever...



My immediate reaction is to call this guy a fucking shitstick but then I thought “No. He’s not a shitstick, he is just uninformed.”  Since I’ve seen this same comment made by lots of people recently and I figured since I’ve actually played the game with four players I should address it here and perhaps ease some fears.

First of all yes it is true that in order to play with four players each person needs their own GBA. While it might sound odd at first, in practice it ends up being fucking brilliant. Imagine that you are playing with three other people. If you haven’t seen the game it’s not played in split screen. Picture a game like Hunter or Zombie Revenge. You’re all on the same screen fighting monsters and picking up loot. Now imagine that you need to access your inventory so that you can equip a new spell you picked up. Were it not for the GBA’s you would have to pause the game in order to bring up your inventory. Meanwhile no one else in your party can do shit because your cycling through menu screens looking for that new Ice spell you just grabbed. That’s bullshit and it would never work.


Instead what happens is that you hit the select button on your GBA and immediately you have access to your entire inventory and character customization menus via the GBA screen. You can sit there and alphabetize your items if you want and you aren’t bothering anyone else. The game is continuing on without you and your character automatically moves to keep up with the rest of the party. The other thing it allows is for multiple people to be using their inventories at the same time. I can be dropping Money for one person while he is dropping a spell for me. Fucking brilliant! This sort of thing would never be possible without the GBA.


Square also uses the GBA connectivity in other cool ways. One person in your party will have access to the map of the level you are in. It’s random so you never know who will be the navigator from level to level. You’re also given goals via your GBA screen before levels begin. Certain things like “Only use magic to kill monsters” or “don’t pick up any items”. Everyone is graded at the end of the level according to how well they accomplished these goals and the people with the highest scores get first dibs on specific kinds of loot picked up by the party during the level.


As wonderful and fantastic and totally fucking bad ass Crystal Chronicles is I will say that I think someone will die because of this game. That’s right, I believe it is only a matter of time before someone kills their friend because of his or her actions in this game. Let me give you some examples of the sort of behavior I have seen spark fights among our own group.


One of the most common ways for a fight to break out is over what we refer to as “Dropping the bucket short.” In case you don’t know the world of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is poisoned and your party carries with it a magical container (the bucket). This container creates a magic bubble around our party that all characters must remain inside if they don’t want to die. In order to progress through the level someone obviously has to carry this bucket around. While holding the bucket a player can’t really do much of anything else. They have to keep an eye on all the other players and make sure that the bubble they are casting is safely covering the entire party. Players that dash off without warning the bucket man often find themselves on the wrong side of the bubble and in a world of hurt. As you can see bucket management is a very important job. It’s easy for the bucket man to get blamed for all kinds of tragedies that might befall the group. “Well if you had just moved the bucket over here I could have killed that guy!”  This is where “Dropping the bucket short” comes in. Monster X appears on the edge of the screen and the party rushes to engage him. The bucket man drops the bucket in order to join the fray but misjudges the size of his bubble and fails to envelope the monster in it. Now the monster sits just outside the bubble firing projectile attacks into it and picking off your party one by one. Meanwhile the members of your group must now brave the poisoned landscape beyond the bubble in order to battle this beast. This is often a lost cause as not only is the monster beating up on them but the very air around them causes massive amounts of damage. It’s not unheard of for an entire party to die this way, simply because of a bucket that was dropped short. 


In our group the bucket man is Robert and there have been times when I thought that Porkfry was actually going to kill him. You see Pork carries a knife that he refers to as Mr. Stabby and it’s already tasted human blood. Recently Pork produced said knife after a particularly disastrous bucket drop left our entire party in spirit form. He waved it menacingly at Robert and as the rest off us held him back he screamed that he was going to “CUT THAT BITCHES FACE!” It took quite a bit of talking and consoling before I was sure that no ones face was going to be cut.  This time everyone survived but who knows if we will be as lucky next time.


Later I’ll tell you about item hording and lollygagging and how it can lead to broken bones and punctured lungs.

161,2003-08-25,How Could They Do Such A Thing,"
Humans are so mad right now, mad that Nintendo is making them buy a GameBoy Advance in order to play Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.  As today's comic makes so plain, Nintendo's treachery leaps straight over garden variety malice and might even be called a vendetta.


This isn't even my fight, it's Gabe's.  I'm not personally invested in it whatsoever, and I appreciate that you have not chosen to inflict upon me that unique genre of mail which now fills his own inbox.  I will tell you, though, that what he says is quite accurate, even if he chooses to agitate you with the manner he delivers the sentiment.  Using the GameBoy Advance as a controller is not only critical to how the game functions, it's fun.      


People are always telling us that you have to have four GameBoys to play it, as though this is proof of some nefarious Nintendo plot.  I am assuming that they say this in an effort to be quarrelsome.  It's excellent fun with any number of players.  The fact of the matter is that it's going to be much harder to find a GameCube than it is to find four people who own GBAs, or even one guy with a couple on hand - maybe he had the old one and got an SP or something.  The installed bases for the two systems aren't even close - take a look at some of these charts over at The Magicbox if you don't believe me.  The disparity is shocking.    


And if you do have a GameCube, I mean, let's be honest - it's got to be because you're a Nintendo fan.  You know what you're in for.  I shudder to think about the gamer who purchases the GameCube unwittingly, their rage growing with each Mario title released.  The GameCube owner is one of the most long-suffering creatures on God's green Earth, there is no reason to own it aside from a devotion to Nintendo.  They have this devotion because every now and then, according to some secret calendar filled with alien holidays, they are rewarded for their diligence.  This is one of those times.  It would be hard to count me among that congregation, as my faith is far from unwavering.  I had to be convinced through actual play - something that separates us from many if not all of the critics - that the GBA/Controller gimmick is more than some perverse marketing scheme.  It is.  Don't you assholes remember when you all said that the new Legend of Celda was for Fags, and then when it came out you had to admit it was great?  Let me cut out the soul-searching phase for you.    


If you're playing the game Single Player, you know, no GBA required.  There's even an advantage there, because in that mode you have a moogle that carries the bucket Gabe mentioned, and he never drops it short.  Also, you can paint him - try that shit on your friend Bob.  Probably not. 


The Lanwerx event on Saturday was a runaway success - and I'd like to thank Bungie very much for the copies of Halo PC they let us use for the event, for the two packed live demos of Halo 2, and for bringing by Joyride's new Halo toys to check out.  I'm also able to say with absolute certainty that if you should enter a Halo Tournament at some point and you are going up against the Notorious Thugs, just get back in your car and go home.  Their moniker is quite accurate:  Notorious because they are well known, and Thugs because they are well known for shooting people.  A couple guys from Wing Commander News stopped by as well, and I checked out the GBA version of Prophecy while we reminisced about Privateer Online.


After constantly hearing it praised and seeing a very nice showing at E3, I finally got a chance to really invest myself in Day of Defeat and did not come away disappointed.  Let me tell you about something else, though - The Goddamn Specialists.  I don't know how many hours I put into that thing, but not a moment that went by that was not characterized by Woo inspired mayhem.  People at the event called it a cross between The Opera and Action Half-Life, and that seems fair enough - your loadout determines how acrobatic you can be, with the (impeccably modeled) dual pistols being a sort of Gold Standard for running on walls, doing flips and shooting down on people, dodging bullets and whatever else.  Once you get the hang of the stunt system - which is strange at first, because it entails looking up, middle, or down while you double-jump - you'll be clearing rooms and doing Mary Lou Retton type shit in no time.  Remedy always said that they'd like to do Max Payne multiplayer, but they just couldn't figure out how to handle the bullet-time - and The Specialists answers the question.  It becomes a powerup.  That wasn't too hard, was it?  Like Double-Fire Rate, Infinite Ammo, Grenade, and any other potential imbalance the ability to slow down time is meted out via powerups with very strict time limits.  Please go get this game, I can't play it yet and it would bring me comfort to know that someone was jumping over someone else while to guys with shotguns clash by the pool. 


Neither DoD or The Specialists is on Steam now, at least not yet, so it looks like I'm off to the mall tomorrow.  After yesterday, I honestly don't know if I can be without those games.       


I mentioned on Friday that I've been trying out Thunderbird, Mozilla's standalone mail client, because I'd heard that it had quite the adaptive spam filter.  It does have that, and it works as well as advertised - but I hate absolutely everything else about it.  The software I'm using is version .2 or some shit, so my attempting to use it for serious daily tasks is like making a fetus the President of the United States.  Mails constantly come in blank, or stripped of the time stamp.  Sometimes, mails arrive from the future.  Sometimes it follows its rules for deleting spam, and sometimes, hey!  Here's a bunch of mail about dicks.

Otogi impressed me a good deal at E3, but after the demo on Official Xbox magazine I had resolved not to get it.  I'm told now that the demo section was basically a lobotomized version of a level later in the game, and it didn't help that the disc that comes with that magazine never quite seems to agree with my machine.  In any case, readers gave me their guarantee that we would not be disappointed - and you won't be either, if you are enthused about straight-ahead, balls-out action games.  The game is largely characterized by its diverse weapon selection, destructible environments, its lavish presentation and just a hint of basil. 


I played it a good deal yesterday over at Gabe's while he drew the comic, and when we stopped off at the store later I had every intention of purchasing it.  Software, Etc. had no intention of holding up their end of the bargain, the Selling Videogames end, as they had only received two copies of it and chastised me for not having reserved it.  I tried to get Bombastic and Republic too, at the store, where one buys games, but they have apparently forgotten how our relationship functions.  The reason this store did not stock these games is because they had not received enough pre-orders for them.  I buy maybe six games a month, most months - shit, in the story I just related, I was about to buy three - and I almost never reserve games.  That's just not how I indicate my interest in a title.  I pre-order a game every once in a blue moon - in cases like Final Fantasies where I fully expect to be trampled to death getting a copy.  I certainly don't pre-order puzzle games where devils - no more than a half-inch tall - run around on dice, or highly involved political strategy games.  And now, they don't stock them, either.  None get ordered because they're sort of obscure, and I dont pre-order for that a host of other reasons.  Awesome system!  


Bombastic and Republic are a couple of the ""pet games"" that I have watched with some interest, many of which all decided to come out at or about the same time.  Etherlords II, the card battle/RPG title from Nival Interactive just went gold, and a demo for it hit just yesterday.  I tried to download the 200 meg file several times, and was only able to get a clean copy via the BitTorrent client - that was about one in the morning, so I haven't had a chance to play it yet.  Readers keep me abreast of gaming's hidden places, I think of them as a black cloud of ravens from which there is no evasion.  In this case, they have served admirably:  X2:  The Threat.  They initially drew my attention to the first one, which I had heard about but never played, and the sequel is silly with beauty and charm.  It's hard for me to zero in on exactly what kind of game it is, but it's clear that at it's base it is a space-sim with many, many other genre elements incorporated.  Download the rolling demo and see how it'll run on your machine with everything on.  I think they're planning on a November US release, which is cool, because that will give me time to buy a new video card.       


Hegemonia is also one of my favorite games, and though I don't see a US publisher yet for the Solon Heritage expansion it stirs my heart to know that one is even in production.  I figured that game would be the sort of thing I would like and nobody else would, as sometimes happens - I thought we might be talking about some Salad Master type shit.  I'm very glad to be wrong.

Otogi is like Shinobi only with better graphics, better music, better level design, a more robust combat system including the ability to purchase new weapons and magic that will alter your characters stats and combos, tighter controls and a camera that actually works. The fact that most stores are only ordering half of a copy though means it might be difficult to get your hands on one. Once again the Pre-ordering system fucks the average gamer in the ass. It's the same thing that happened with REZ, ICO and APEX. They don't get many pre-orders so they only get in a few copies. Then everyone realizes what an awesome game it is and you can't fucking buy it anywhere.


I don't understand why I can't just walk into a game store and buy a videogame. I don't have to talk to some jackass over at Safeway three months before I wanna buy some milk. ""Yeah bob listen, I'm gonna want to get my hands on some frozen yogurt come next December. How about I leave you a ten spot and you call me when my shit comes in."" The entire Pre-ordering system helps no one except EB, Gamestop and the dozen or so other game stores that are all really just the same store but they call them a different name so that you don't feel like one giant mega-company is taking all your money even though that's totally the fucking case. 


Maybe we should do something about this. I'm not sure just what yet but I think that if we all decided that we wanted this to change we could probably do that. Let's all put our thinking caps on and see what we can come up with. The sooner I don't have to hear ""I'm sorry, did you have a pre-order?"" the fucking better.


On a completely unrelated note I would like to continue my ""helping people out"" streak that I started with my plug for Red Eye PC yesterday. Only this time I'd like to plug my own wife. Hmmm…that didn't come out quite right. In any case Kara is in school right now learning how to manipulate hair in new and exciting ways. Now she is actually out on the floor cutting and styling the hair of real human beings which is a comfort to me as I no longer find terrifying mannequin heads all over the house. So if you're in need of some kind of hair maintenance she would very much appreciate your patronage. Keep in mind this is a school and she is a student but I can vouch for her skills. She's taken her shears to me on numerous occasions and I've come through with hardly a scratch on me. It also means that you get a good deal on your hair cut. Gene Juarez is a super shmancy salon but at the school a haircut is only like ten bucks. If you are in the Seattle area just call the Gene Juarez academy at 206-365-6900 and tell them you want to schedule an appointment with Danica. Yeah, I know her name is Kara but they have a bunch of girls at the school with similar names so she had to pick a new one. I like to think of it as her handle, in fact I told her she should have chosen LORD_H3LLHAMM3R666 and then gotten an AIM account.

This strip won't make as much sense if you haven't read Alex ""Marweas"" Rodberg's now legendary quote from this RelicNews forum thread.  And let's be absolutely transparent - he and I do not disagree materially on the quality of forum discourse in the most general sense.  In fact, I believe I'm quoted as saying that they ""appear to incubate and empower a twisted menagerie of fucking assholes.""  And no-one knows better than I do how difficult, almost impossible it is to please truly dedicated gamers.  These are all matters quite apart from how the public face of a company should comport itself.   

When discussing comparatively inexpensive games a week or so ago, I mentioned Port Royale in passing.  I've played it for an additional two solid days since then, and what was once infatuation has blossomed into a genuine commitment.  Comparing any game to the original Pirates! is rank heresy, I know - it's like comparing your Uncle Bob who plays the harmonica favorably with Jesus.  And Sid Meier is preparing a follow-up to his classic Pirates!, and it will probably be excellent because everything he produces is excellent.  I have even heard that his tears can raise the dead!  Port Royale, though, takes the Pirates template and coaxes it into even greater brilliance.  To my mind, the greatest addition is an extremely dynamic economy of twenty or so commodities - and check this out.  Using an interface that will fucking enrage you the first time and then it's not so bad, you can set up completely independent convoys of ships with programmable ""Trade Routes"" that can - if well managed - make you a lot of money while you take quests and curry favor with governors.  You can make it as complex as you'd like to, dropping things off at special buildings you've constructed in different places, selling and buying at certain prices, choosing which towns you'll repair in, you get the idea.  The ones I've made are fairly basic, only three cities tops, but they do alright - I haven't tried any of the downloadable routes from Fame n' Fortune yet, but I shudder to think of the profits one could garner with a spreadsheet and a lot of free time.  I have no idea how this game got to be thirty dollars, but if they're going to keep selling it for that don't ask any questions.  I wouldn't even bring it up.    


The server is so busy these days that I have a hard time getting images up when I want to show you something, and ninety percent of the time that's probably a good thing for you.  Cats in lederhosen or cats in other traditional garb are probably not something you need in any great supply.  However, I had some Tron 2.0 screens I took that might interest you, just as regular geeks and not necessarily Tron zealots like myself - pictures of the Internet, what it looks like inside a firewall, I was essentially on safari.  I wish there was more Tron left, I'm sort of depressed now that I've finished it.  It's going to sound stupid, but I felt better knowing I had someplace else to go.

Explaining this strip would be impossible, except to say that it is - like the Claw Shrimp strip - a precise transcript of a conversation.  I know that there are people who come by Penny Arcade exclusively for the cock talk, and who are we to deny them?      


We've really had and embarrassment of riches lately when it comes to demos, eh?  You can invest yourself solely in interactive demos these days and never have a spare moment.  The Etherlords II demo I mentioned a couple days ago has two or three hours of gameplay in it, depending on how you play - I like the move away from the Heroes of Might and Magic style ""levels"" and the move towards persistent, RPG style characters.  Aside from some...  overzealous voice acting on the part of the Synthets, that demo is damned near perfect - you get a chance to play the game at your own pace, for an amount of time that feels substantial.  Of course, Nival also recently put out the English demo for their brilliant tactical RPG Silent Storm, which is brilliant, tactical, etc.  It was a rough road getting there, but the Call of Duty demo hit all the community sites a few days ago and it seems to have generated feelings of warmth and contentment for many players.  This is, to my recollection, the same demo they had playable at E3 this year.  So while it might have been difficult to get too worked up over it, it was nice to see that it ran really, really well on my machine, and it's nice that everyone else can see what I was talking about when I said that the MOH:AA team could top themselves.  I was really hoping for some multiplayer out of this demo, we played Medal of Honor nightly - warts and all - and I look forward to seeing what they deliver on that front.  And today, for fuck's sake, we're blessed beyond the reach of reason - a Homeworld 2 demo, with a tutorial, two single, and two multiplayer missions.  Commandos 3 demo is out, and there's also a Worms 3D demo about to hit.  What have we done to deserve such riches?  Aside from propping up their entire industry, I mean.      


Going back to the Call of Duty thing, though - did you hear about that at all?  How FilePlanet originally had exclusivity on the demo, and all the community download sites basically said fuck that?  Activision (and others, no doubt) learned their lesson where that's concerned - the support of the community download sites is a practical requirement for any publisher looking to push a 200 meg binary.  Why would they stoop to distributing their own promotional materials, when they can get the customers to handle that, too?  It's a twisted marvel.     


I remembered keen Penny Arcade readers having praised an e-mail client called The Bat! last time I was having some kind of mail crisis, and I will admit to having been charmed by the notion - I liked the idea of a tough, non-nonsense bat in charge of my correspondence, and the exclamation point seemed to imply festivity.  I'm really happy with it so far, and even though it has some extremely potent tools for managing spam I'm trying out a free spam proxy thing called SpamPal that seems to work pretty alright, if not a little overzealous at times.  Unfortunately, I've had to basically clear out the bad_words spam filter as I use virtually every one of the cited terms in the course of normal conversation.

I'm not sure if there is a slipperier slope than trying to determine creative primacy, and the slope in question is further lubricated by the fact that we're talking about not only popular culture but also literary heritage and folklore.  Everyone borrows.  Some borrow more than others, and we have laws to govern that sort of double-dipping.  But it remains to be seen whether the court will find in White Wolf's favor where the movie Underworld is concerned. 


I was always more of a Mage or Wraith man - I put that out there to extricate myself from the taint of other White Wolf games, but really that's like saying that you absolutely refuse to have sex with animals but that you do occasionally fuck corpses.  It doesn't quite fix the problem.  It became clear that if I was to continue playing Vampire, that would require hanging around with the sort of people who played Vampire, which is something I think we all want to avoid.


To be honest, as regards Underworld, I thought of Romeo and Juliet before I thought of the World of Darkness.  The lawsuit claims that the movie draws heavily from a story called Love Of Monsters - I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but the idea of Vampires and Werewolves loving each other ain't that special.  I don't doubt that it would make a very fine movie, or story - Romeo and Juliet is a Goddamn timeless template.  I saw it set in Ireland with an all female cast and it still worked, one family was all lesbians and one was all dinosaurs.  You just can't fuck it up.  You dab your eyes at the end and wonder what is so wrong about the love of a lesbian for a dinosaur.              


The trailers I've seen are like a gothic The Matrix, and I don't doubt that it was pitched using very similar terminology.  I'm wondering why White Wolf didn't sue Blade, if they like suing so much - when the first movie trotted out the different vampire families at the end, with all their symbols and whatnot, I was all ready to roll some ten-siders and expend my blood pool on some dark gifts.  Okay, maybe I played a lot of Vampire.  I never wore a Dog Collar or anything, which is a great comfort to me.    


You can read the complaint here, if you'd like - I was able to secure a copy.  I thought I knew how much they were asking for, and included that value in an earlier version of this post, but I'm sure I was wrong.   If Penny Arcade has taught me anything, it's that regular human beings cannot read and interpret legal documents - it looks like English, but it is actually a new mathematics which can pierce, yea, even unto the fifth dimension.  So even if it says something that seems obvious, remember that it's somebody's whole job to make it look really stupid, and they'll have Sony's resources at their disposal to do so.  Provided they don't just give White Wolf the money in a briefcase.  Of Darkness!


Okay, maybe I did wear a Dog Collar for a short while.  It was meant in an Ironic Fashion, and regretted it immediately.

I just grabbed the new update to Xbox Live, which adds considerable functionality - booting up the system without a game in logs you in to Xbox Live automatically, and places you in a new UI where you can manage your Friends list, voice chat, and receive invites.

Everyone is by now quite aware of the over 200 lawsuits the RIAA has brought against regular human beings, some of whom had no idea what they were doing was questionable legally.  We certainly knew that it was, that's part of what made it so great, but that has not stopped us from making a very genuine statement regarding our prior life of sin.  We're actually referring to a ""program"" they've devised, called ""Clean Slate,"" where you can tell them you've been naughty and promise never to be bad ever again.  Forgive me for saying so, but it doesn't seem wise to identify yourself.  Call me fucking crazy.       


""We're trying to send a strong message that you are not anonymous when you participate in peer-to-peer file-sharing and that the illegal distribution of copyrighted music has consequences,"" said Mitch Bainwol, RIAA chairman and chief executive officer. ""And as this case illustrates, parents need to be aware of what their children are doing on their computers.""



Wow.  I agree with the RIAA on something.  That's actually kind of scary.


I'd certainly like to be enraged about this stuff, and I certainly find the RIAA's position on twelve-year olds who share music abhorrent - but this has been coming for a long time.  I rarely use file-sharing apps anymore, but it's got nothing to do with morality.  The labels have done an excellent job of making them almost useless to me by flooding them with dopplegangers that look like real songs but are actually five minutes of beeps, which is fine when I'm looking for techno.  The main reason I was using peer-to-peer services wasn't even convenience, it was because buying CDs at the snooty record store down the street was getting too expensive.  They'd look down their nose at my selections, and I'd feel so ashamed if I didn't sort of balance it out with an expensive import from some band I'd never heard of.  


The sharing of certain files is illegal.  The courts have determined that the programs you use to do it are legal, in the same way that a VCR or a photocopy machine is legal, because they have substantial non-infringing uses - there are a lot of things you can do with them that are perfectly fine.  You can share my songs from hell to breakfast, for example, and you'll never hear a cross word from me.  But it's easy with a program like Kazaa to see that an individual has files owned by RIAA members, and then if the ISP complies it's easy to find out who you are.  So as mad as I want to get, we are essentially talking about people being held accountable for breaking the law.  I'm certainly not suggesting that you stop doing it, or whatever - it's up to you, but this is a potent bit of Public Relations Theatre they're enacting and I think it's going to work on a lot of people.  I am simply going to suggest that you break the law in a more anonymous fashion.  In much the way the people at school might suggest that you employ some manner of prophylactic when engaging in ""extra-curricular activities,"" I am suggesting that you employ a similar tactic in your virtual life - by utilizing applications that anonymize.

174,2003-09-15,I Always Knew This Day Would Come,"
In days of old, I established the parameters of Gabriel's affection for RPG in a two strip series entitled The Cycle.  He has been my project in this regard, a sort of rogue protege, but until a game came out that combined Star Wars and role-playing my lessons never took root.  Immediately after Knights of the Old Republic, he started playing Final Fantasy X, then he moved on to Final Fantasy IX, and now - joy of joys! - he's moved on to the tactical battle game everyone seems to love, Disgaea.  Not only is he playing it, he beat me to it.  I'm trying to figure out if that makes me mad or not.


I've heard people complain that Valve's Steam won't allow them to play their games on a LAN, which I suppose is a real issue for some people.  I guess they're working on a solution to that, but they can take their time as far as I'm concerned - the LANs I go to have Net access, I wasn't aware that was such a luxury.  My problem with Steam is that up until Yesterday, it didn't fucking work.  So if we're rating these problems on severity, I win. 


Any time I get a chance to, I extol the virtues of digital content delivery.  What I'd like to do is allay your fears about Steam so you'll agree with me, and then I'll be right, but I could not do that with a straight face.  What Valve's recent Steam launch proves is that the concept works great, as long as nobody wants what you're delivering.  It was in every way reminiscent of the Chernobyls that accompany the release of an MMO, except that Massively Multiplayer games aren't gong to try and squeeze out a gig to each player.  Massively Multiplayer games also don't start out with this kind of inherent userbase.  Despite their best efforts, I don't think it could have gone well - Valve is yoked to the largest action playerbase in the world.  Two points:  


1.  Local Content Migration was fucked up the ass.


I thought this was a brilliant concept when I heard about it, because if it had worked I'd imagine things would have gone a lot smoother.  People who download Steam aren't exactly indifferent to the Half-Life engine or the mods that sustain it.  It is a fair bet that a huge percentage - if not all - of the people who use Steam have Half-Life plus mods somewhere on one of their hard disks.  What the content migration facility was supposed to do was take those files you already had and transfer them directly into Steam.  That means people don't have to download a gig apiece from beleaguered servers on the first day, which were already in the throes of a data apocalypse.  What percentage of that impenetrable load the first two days was due to failed migrations, I couldn't tell you - but I do have the trick from the FAQ I used to get going.  Inside your Steam folder, there's a folder called SteamApps, and inside SteamApps there should be a folder named whatever your e-mail address is.  If you make a folder inside that folder called ""Half-Life"" and copy (or install) mods straight in there, they'll show up in Steam under ""Third Party Games"" and you'll be ready to go.  I was just going to link to their FAQ, but their site is broken right now, which I appreciate because it basically vindicates my whole shit.  You can see now that they put up a new installer that includes Counter-Strike 1.6, instead of having to get it through them.  It was a good idea, even if it does establish their culpability in these failures.            


Maybe Content Migration worked just fine for some people, but it didn't work on either of my machines.  And every machine it didn't work on represents more load on a system already trying to cope with distributing the most popular game in the world.    


2.  It doesn't make any difference why it was fucked up.


It just doesn't.  That's not the future of content delivery, it's the future of fucking pissing me off.  I can't be the only one who was using the Steam launch to determine how my Half-Life 2 install would go when I bought it through their service, and it seems fair to assume that HL2 is going to be a damn sight larger than Counter-Strike.  Oh, I'll still try to get it online, because I am stupid and I think that each day will be brighter than the last.  My only comfort in this matter is that enough people will be scared off by either this experience or an overall distaste for electronic delivery that I'll be able to get my stuff.  Now that's confidence.   


I had all these Half-Baked theories about how Valve would still deliver HL2 on the thirtieth as claimed, because it would be a Steam only release that didn't necessarily have to jibe with the release dates we were seeing from retail chains, with Team Fortress 2 as an incentive...  I don't know why I invested my mind in creating excuses for them, but they need to start communicating with gamers about when and why things are happening.

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has - among many, many other things - a system of laws and judges that govern the methods used to achieve victory in each battle.  And when I say the methods, I mean your methods, because the huge lizards you must sometimes conquer don't give a flying fuck about the rules.  I had seen a screenshot once that I thought showed a representation of one of the judges, and it looked like a young vulture.  I understand now that judges are (in fact) huge armored bad-asses who ride vicious chocobos, which makes more sense.  I couldn't figure out why you would do something just because a bird told you to.


Back when an invincible new technique had been developed to install Linux on the Xbox, I suggested in the post that Microsoft would have an easy time of counteracting it - I submitted that the difficulty index of this feat would be somewhere between closing a drawer and opening a cupboard.  Do not doubt that within five minutes of speaking the truth, psychotic Linux advocates burst into my Inbox decrying my latest sins against their noble order.  They claimed for a variety of reasons that Microsoft would be unable to do this, supplying little more than enthusiasm to support their declarations.  I never really investigated prophecy as a career choice, but when you think about it Microsoft pissing off the Linux community isn't really a tough call.  So when I read that the latest Xbox Live update had also disabled Linux for some people, just as I had suggested might be possible, it was difficult not to feel smug.             


This isn't Gabe you're talking to here, opposed to ROMs, surly in general toward those who feel that using technology on their own terms is a form of civil disobedience.  I don't have a problem philosophically with people who want to fuck around inside their Xbox, a highly subsidized, general-purpose computer.  The irony involved in subverting M$ hardware no doubt has varying levels of succulence for some users.  What I do not understand is why people feel as though Microsoft is obligated in some way to make it easy for them.  They are most certainly not obligated to assist you, via signed bootloaders or any other method.    


I had mentioned an article claiming that Canada had some kind of footloose approach to filesharing, and was (in effect) an untouched digital Eden.

Gamespy has their latest adorable attempt at relevance up, a list of the 25 most overrated games of all time.  You can go look at it if you want, I'm certainly not putting a link to it here - suffice it to say, where it is obvious it is obvious, and where they attempt to be brash and iconoclastic it's just insulting.  We've done a comic on it, I'll take it frame by frame it.


Panel One:  Trying to understand the feature itself is a chore, because they have four separate classifications for Overrated-ness, and some games fall into more than one category.  Some games are overrated by Critics, some games are not as good as earlier ones in a series, and some are both - but whether or not earlier games in a series were simply ""Overrated By Critics"" might be difficult to ascertain.  While I do enjoy a bit of bracing mental exercise, the content on Gamespy isn't exactly a fucking brain Nautilus.        


Panel Two:  Years ago, when I was playing a lot of Front Line Force, I really appreciated Gamespy Arcade's buddy lists and invigorating interstitial ads.  However, I think the period of time where such an application was required or even desirable has past.  Server Browsers, that's one thing - a nice, lightweight affair like All Seeing Eye is still within the realm of sanity.  Most browsers internal to games are acceptable, and Gamespy licensed backends are perfectly serviceable when inbuilt.  But the universe where I utilize their heavily branded portal to browse for games seems very distant.


Panel Three:  Everyone likes to have fun.  I'm having fun right now!  So I don't mind them having a little bit of fun with their list.  But when you feign ignorance or discard historical perspective so you can look fancy, I don't have to tolerate your stupid ass anymore.  When you deny the profound effect of Donkey Kong Country's fully rendered sprites in 1994, making the system a bulwark against the 32-bit revolution, there is no educating you.  When you are seemingly unaware of the dramatic progress in both modeling and Internet play that Quake II was, and when you start to talk some shit about Final Fantasy VII - the game that absolutely pierced the mainstream and deposited the notion of gaming into a new generation - we've got nothing to discuss.  You're assholes or retards, and I don't care which.


You really have to go out of your way to make me mad these days, because I'm playing the great games of today that GameSpy or its vacuous future variant will one day overrate, only to lament the fact in some empty expose - without so much as a nod to what the games meant to the period, the system, or indeed to the history of our preferred entertainment medium.  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a highly amusing marvel of affectionate production, will no doubt be relegated to whatever bin their hideous cyborg interns reserve for games they suddenly revile.

179,2003-09-22,The Day Is Full Of Moments,"
You'll find that the average day is honeycombed with perfectly good moments to invest in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.  At least, that's what we found, and we weren't even looking very hard.  Also, you'll note that I mentioned Desert Combat in the strip - let me establish that the version I'm playing is .4, the most recent one, and let me further establish that as of this release I think that this mod has EA on the run.  Secret Weapons is real fun, and I don't regret purchasing it - but with a growing stable of fine maps and exquisite vehicles, Desert Combat is quickly becoming the definitive Battlefield 1942 experience.       


GameSpot pulled their 5.4 review of Savage, which fascinates me and maybe you - did you hear why?  The developer, S2 Games, claims that their servers only register a couple hours of Savage play for the reviewer in question - and in the face of that 5.4 review, they were understandably pissed off.  Savage isn't quite like other games, and as my mind wanders through the experiences I've had playing it, it makes it difficult to decry the Gamespot review score with any real force.


I'm making a new paragraph, but I'm still talking about Savage.


I have been discussing other things, so I never had an opportunity to talk about how Savage was received at the last Gaming Day we had.  For the record, there wasn't a cross word spoken about the game - and it was played virtually all day.  We were lucky enough to have an old hand from the beta there, the wily Nilt, and he got us a dedicated server going that ran great whenever somebody wasn't playing Counter-Strike on it.  Savage isn't like other games, as I said earlier - it combines real-time strategy and FPS gameplay in a way that I believe is an acquired taste.  A LAN environment is practically a best-case scenario, because the barked orders, commiseration, and silken connection resolve the issues you might have playing it online - where lag might be an issue, where you feel disconnected from your teammates, or where despite very clear directives from your commander in the UI his overall strategy is not apparent.  In my experience with the game, the issues you're likely to have are more social than technical.  I don't think it impossible that the reviewer played the game for two or three hours - note that this could actually represent only three games of actual playtime - without ever having a round that truly gelled the Savage experience for him.  And if he played it for a few hours and determined that there was, in fact, nothing there, I don't fault him for that.  S2 Games, they can be as mad as they want to about it - some guy who has barely scratched the surface saying shit like that actually costs them money.  But for my part, if their Savage did nothing to keep him, there are undoubtedly many other people for whom the game will hold no pleasure.  Though it is difficult for me to imagine that the sight of a behemoth - a towering monster whose chosen weapon is an entire tree - would not produce some lasting emotion in you as you see it lumber toward your base, apparently there are people who do not believe Jennifer Love Hewitt is an angel from heaven.  I submit this as proof that anything is possible.                    


If a review is a pack of lies - you might recall Gabe going line by line on a particularly grievous Lost Kingdoms 2 review - then clearly it is in our best interests to come out swinging.  We have a well-earned reputation as ne'er-do-wells, a rowdy roadhouse on the fringe of Gaming Media.  But I actually want reviewers to, if you'll excuse the term, savage games they don't enjoy.  I also don't need authorization from some fucker in order to like a game, so they can score games any way they want.  I do my part here as a sort of advocate for games I think have been mistreated by the larger press.  I certainly don't do it because I believe our perspective is the definitive one - I do it because I think that reviewing games as such is better thought of as a conversation than as an unflinching edict from some distant source.  I'm simply trying to contribute my part.         


The only thing I really don't enjoy about Savage was that in order to repair something or really bash down a building with melee attacks, you have to click rather a lot, over and over, for a very long time.  It's tedious.  Luckily, Nilt came to the rescue here as well.  Bring down the console with the ~ thing, and enter ""bind key toggle button1"" where ""key"" is whatever key you want to hold down.  See?  That wasn't so bad.

it's totally meaningless

I really must maintain that I have no inherent lust for Doom 3.  I have to buy it, of course - out of a misguided sense of tradition, which they are no doubt banking on.  I'm being serious, though.  Read this love letter to id on it over at GameSpot and tell me if it sounds like any original ideas made it in.  I submit that they have not. 


I went long on something else Monday, the Savage thing, and I didn't have the patience to enunciate my impressions of The Temple of Elemental Evil.   


The game came out early as you might recall, which I thought was a boon.  You'll note that no-one ever celebrates an early pregnancy, and there's a reason for that - human beings need to ""bake"" for a set period of time, upon completion of which they can be considered ""done.""  The Temple Of Elemental Evil is not what I would consider ""done.""  It is, however, very cool, which is what makes discussing it complex.


Let me begin by saying that this is the most accurate representation of the modern Dungeons and Dragons combat system in existence.  Neverwinter Nights is great and all, I'm on record as holding that position.  But without going into too much detail - trust me, it is not possible to establish in this space the comparative complexity of the systems - allow me to compare Neverwinter's system to Temple's annoying, imitative kid brother.  They each made choices about how to manifest Dungeons and Dragons, Bioware made the choices that would be right for most people, and Troika let the source material make the decisions.  There's no other way to put it.            


Everything else about the game leaps frantically from brilliant to bullshit.  They have a potent, forward-looking radial menu system that allows hotkey access to truly vast individual functionality - similar to Neverwinter's, but heaped high with esoteric combat functions - but this intuitive mechanism simply doesn't exist outside the main game screen.  The metaphor needed to extend over the entire game - particularly the inventory screen, whose functionality is cumbersome everywhere it isn't deliberately obscured.  Even there, there are kernels of cleverness - a set of tabs to create a handful of different configurations, a welcome feature in a game where you're constantly swapping equipment to deal with new situations.  Identifying items works in a way counter to the source material.  Temple has a great, in-line hypertext help system that clarifies many rules.  The game runs poorly.  Do you see what I mean?  I've been thinking about this for days, I got it the day it came out.  I feel like I'm losing my mind when I try to come to some conclusion about this game.             


The rules of D&D, while not as complex as some pen and paper systems, can throw you for a loop even if you're reasonably familiar with them.  This made many discussions on the forums seem like battles in and of themselves, as one side would call perfectly canonical decisions ""bugs,"" and vice versa.  Even outside the continuum of that discussion, there is still a robust supply of issues with the game - and, as this recent chat reveals, Atari released the game before Troika was done with it, cut out some evil dialogue paths, and now Troika has no contract with them that would cover the production of a patch.  They still want to make one, they just can't tell us anything with specificity.  Well, awesome.     


It like some kind of test from God.  As an unabashed fan of Greyhawk and Dungeons and Dragons, can you brave the slipshod production and questionable decisions in order to enjoy the most accurate D&D game to date?  


You may recall my surprise and pleasure at discovering the Tom Clancy Companion Disc while rooting around at the EB website.  The link they had available for it doesn't work anymore, as it turns out - near as I can tell, it's a pre-order offer now and nothing else.  They must have realized that absolutely every person who wanted Rainbow Six 3 on the Xbox would probably put down a little money to play it early, and they might as well convert fans of Splinter Cell and Ghost Recon into buyers of the new game while they were at it.  I've heard that they plan to release these new levels eventually over Live anyway, but since I can't find that press release I don't invest that statement with any certainty.  At any rate, Ghost Recon is pretty much what I'm playing on the Xbox at the moment, Island Thunder specifically, and it's something of a credit to it that a game that is essentially two years old manages to be Xbox Live's most compelling offering at the moment.  I neglected to mention it, but not because I wasn't thinking about it a lot - you have, by now, seen the new trailers they have at the Splinter Cell site and elsewhere for Pandora Tomorrow.  You're all perfectly aware of my fixation not only with the original Splinter Cell but also with choking people, two interests that really dovetail nicely.  If you're already an enthusiast, though, the new trailers raise a lot of extremely interesting questions - we see multiple people sneaking for one thing, obviously that's just the multiplayer mode we already know about, but seeing it is still interesting.  But what about these first-person shots?  Is there some kind of mode where players sneak through areas guarded by other players?  In fact, the entire video seems to be dedicated to some sort of unannounced genre of multiplayer experience.  And what could the lizards and ancient statues represent?  Very curious indeed.                 


Also, it's official:  Half-Life 2 has been delayed.  Though it was clearly foolhardy at this late hour, I was still generating whole realities where Valve could get the game out on time.  It's probably for the best, I've realized.  Gives me time to play Etherlords II.  And Billy Hatcher.  And Homeworld 2.  And Freedom Fighters.  And UFO: Aftermath...

181,2003-09-26,(Tiger) Woo,"
Okay, maybe I do care a little, just not enough to discuss it with Gabe all Goddamn afternoon.  As a golf game, Tiger Woods 2004 is very near perfect - as the sequel to Tiger Woods 2003, they were starting from a pretty good point.  For new features, we've got Game Face (the facility we describe in the strip) which allows you to create an eerily accurate representation of yourself.  Then you can delete that representation and use Tiger Woods or the variant Super Duper Sunday Tiger, which is like an unstoppable golf cyborg.  There's also a vastly expanded Pro Shop, where you can procure ""Lucky"" garb for your character, some of it in sales that change daily.  Look out for ""Real Time Events,"" such as eclipses or birthdays, that will offer unique challenges.  This is all quite apart from the huge number of courses, which include holes you must maneuver the ball into.  As a golf game, it's pretty hard to beat.  The only chink in its armor is the online play, and if - as a satisfied fan of the 2003 version - you purchased the game explicitly for its online additions, obviously that's going to stick out.


After a couple more days of play, Gabe likely has some words to put down on the game, so I'll leave him to it.  If he is too bored or too enraged with the topic, I'm perfectly capable of paraphrasing his assertions.  If he pops up here later, I won't worry about it.


After a couple false starts, I was able to obtain that Clancy preview disc and let me tell you - I feel spritely and full of energy now, bounding like a fawn.  The new maps for Island Thunder are (if my research is correct) drawn from the PC Desert Siege expansion, and seem to be held is fairly high regard.  I'm trying to figure out if they'd eventually be distributed via Live, because as nice as it is to have them I really do need people to play them with.  The Rainbow Six 3 demo was fairly exciting, and I am trying to remember exactly if this demo was the same one I played at E3.  I believe it very well may be.  Playing it without time constraints or the deafening roar of that psychotic madhouse has been enjoyable, however.  Easy access to Thermal and Nightvision modes, coupled with the soft glow that accompanies nearly everything make for pretty easy comparisons to Splinter Cell.  The polish on the included level is startling, and if this is representative of the gameplay in general you'll see more Action-Packed Firefights instead of sneaking around by dumpsters.  I guess we'll see, I don't really mind tuning the play somewhat for the console, and the combat felt good.  It would have been interesting to include a little Live play in the demo, but that's pretty wishful thinking on my part.  If I've understood the available information correctly, you can either Push-To-Talk for communication with your teammates, or you can just speak and it will be heard by those in your immediate vicinity.  I don't know why that excites me so much.  Part of it is, I suppose, the ability to speak directly into the environment.  That sounds good to me.  But I'm also interested to see if that gets used in gameplay at all, overhearing people, sneaking up on them and introducing yourself, things of that nature.             

My friend MG from down Singapore way let me know that the game Shattered Galaxy - a sort or massively multiplayer RTS - is now free to play, with a few restrictions.  In any case, even keeping those in mind, you really can't beat the price - and I enjoyed my time with the game immensely.

I may have been rude.  The only thing that will improve my mood, though, is Etherlords II, so as far as retail employees are concerned it's kind of a Catch-22.   


Gabe only just spoke about Links, comparing it with great virulence to Tiger Woods 2004.  Even I was surprised at the vigor of his critique, because I've seen a great deal of the new Tiger and have come to the conclusion that it is a game of extraordinary polish, rich with features.  But I understand what he means, now - things like Real-Time events which take place during an Eclipse or lucky shirts in the Pro Shop are interesting additions, but they do not have anything to do with Golfing.  A DMX track does not correlate to Golfing.  These extra features are for people who don't have a lot of interest in Golf as an actual sport, and amount to tricks designed to ensnare the mainstream player, i.e., me.  I thought it was an interesting perspective.    


We saw other games there, and I'll talk about those in more detail today and Friday.  You can read about Amped 2 someplace else, though.  It was alright, I didn't throw up on the guy who was showing it to us or anything but it didn't interest me enough to drone on at length about it. 


Top Spin, however, is a game I could stand to drone on about.  Virtua Tennis, we've all heard of it.  If a man came up to me on the street, as sometimes happens, and said ""Virtua Tennis is the finest sports game ever made,"" I'd be likely to agree with him.  I'd also wonder why he said that, but whatever - maybe he started playing it again.  For people somewhat outside the continuum of Sports Titles in general, people who approach the genre a bit mystified about the rules of the various sports, VT is just about Goddamn perfect - in essence, a highly competitive action game with stunningly elegant control and great visuals.  The people who made Top Spin have played a lot of Virtua Tennis.  A lot.  Except they added a character customization engine that equals anything EA's Game Face can produce, included literally a fuck-ton of courts, and then threw in four-player online modes.         


Blah blah career mode, blah blah blah different countries blah public courts blah blah fascism.  Take it online, though, and just as in MechAssault a friend at your house can join as a guest and you can go head to head with another team online.  Of course, because Top Spin is a part of this XSN Sports thing, you'll have leagues, tournaments, and other things that Microsoft hopes you will be interested in.   After each point, there's buttons you can hit on the controller to determine your reaction to it - obviously, they're skippable.  I don't know how many times you'd want to watch your online foe caper around the court, swinging his racket like Excalibur, but I'm certain it's a number less than one.  In any case, in your mind just think about fluid VT controls, with a host of shot additions - there's four shot styles on the face, words like ""lob"" and ""slice"" that mean nothing to me, and two ""skill shots"" on the triggers that require a bit of finesse to operate.  Those I understand, because they're far more pyrotechnic than the others.  For example, the right trigger is an overhand shot which attempts to lodge the ball in your opponent's urethra.  If you know anything about urethras, you know this is a very difficult shot to master - as soon as you grab the trigger, you'll see a gauge open with a line that travels top to bottom in rapid succession.  Release it on the sweet-spot in the middle, and you're rewarded with a perfect shot.  The left trigger does what's called a Drop Shot, a definition of which can be found here, but it requires a similar timed shot to make it work right.  Taking risks on shots like that will eventually place you securely In The Zone, which is like being on fire with preternatural tennis ability.  It engorges that sweet-spot I mentioned earlier, making it larger and more sensitive.            


I'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 2 a bit on Friday.  I thought I'd be able to fit that in today, but there's just a lot of information to convey, and since I actually liked it a lot I'll probably take up too much time discussing it.


When we added advertising to the site after being completely reader supported for over a year, it had been our intention to collapse the Donation System altogether.  It didn't seem right to run with both systems concurrently, and if we were going to do it, it seemed like we should do it all the way.  You can imagine my surprise when our suggestion that we close that down was met with resistance.  ""Please don't give us money!"" is usually a positive development.  Of course, at the time we were pilloried for it - using both systems - but contributing to the site had apparently become very important to many people, it was a way to actively ensure that the site remained operational.  I'm not making that up.  They remembered when the site had gone away and might never have come back if it weren't for them.  These days, we just aren't in that kind of danger.  It's not that I don't like money, indeed, my avarice is comparable to that of a Rap Star.  But we can't in good conscience keep the Donations System up and running.  Essentially, it worked!  The Internet was broken as a means of sustainable creative distribution, and you fixed it.  I sometimes read this or that exhausting essay on Micropayments, and how they died on the cross to cleanse us of sin, or some other pleasing tale.  The hard facts of the matter are thus:  the readers of this site, without the assistance of futuristic technologies, made it happen.  They didn't wait.  They fixed it right now, in place.

Someone, or someones I suppose, managed to get their mitts on the source code for not only Half Life 2 but apparently Steam and Team Fortress 2, which looks as though it might make up the multiplayer portion.  Then Gabe wanted to discuss it on some rational level, which was, you know, embarrassing for him.  I'm thinking about just releasing him into the wild, maybe putting out one of those feeders so he doesn't eat one of the neighborhood cats.  


The concern I've seen voiced about the stolen source code is that the game will be a non-stop carnival of cheating and hackery because of it, and I'm not any more worried about that now than I was before.  Half-Life 2 will attract top-tier hacking talent because it's going to be a great market for their ""services.""  Imagine a shadow market that exists as a reflection of trends in the actual one, total user base being the key figure - the work that these dark developers do has much greater potential to distort games and such in a context rich with players.  Call me crazy, but I have a feeling HL2 will do alright at retail.  Like the source code itself, the compiled game's online community will be an irresistible target for stupid, evil assholes.  The best minds of the aforementioned shadow market will be hard at work trying to ruin our fun, and even a head start doesn't alter that fundamental principle.  At least with this delay, there's a chance Valve can move the target a bit.        


I would have made this post a bit earlier than I did, but I was embroiled in intense fantasy combats on Saturday from four-thirty in the afternoon until two in the morning, skirmishes that made me really appreciate the detail that Troika brought to Temple of Elemental Evil's battle system, if nothing else.  It also reminded me to mention that Atari had recently put out a press release saying they'll allow a patch for the game, as though they were digging deep but they knew it was the right thing to do.  Gamespot even referred to the patch as an ""upgrade,"" which is a pretty charitable description.  In the spirit of rough candor attributed to the youth of this age, fuck Atari, Infogrames, whatever they're calling themselves now.  Musta stung a little bit to see the players, your customers, beat you to the punch, huh?  I'm not even vouching for that patch, I'm saying that their game was so screwed up that just two-and-a-half weeks after release, the community decided to take matters into their own hands while Atari counted their money.           


Gabe felt bad that people who don't give a fuck about Scott Kurtz - a set which includes every thinking person - didn't really get a comic on Friday.  I suggested that we do a new comic, I told him I'd even do a post to accompany it, and that seemed to cheer him up a bit.  As for Player Vs. Player, this episode has been highly instructive for me.  Scott is like some vagrant who draws on a brick wall with a stream of his own pee, he is no longer relevant in any quantity that I measure.  He taunted us, and we took the bait.  The only thing I can say in my defense is that I really, really like bait.

I don't know what the hell is happening with him, though it does look like the turn-based strategy RPG thing is now a permanent element of his construction.  He came back from EB with copies of Final Fantasy VII and Tactics, and other than a slight altercation at the store he doesn't seem any worse for wear.


As complete as his conversion seems to be, and I will interrogate him to determine the parameters of this fascination, I think he might be hard pressed to enjoy the new Dynasty Tactics.  No game I have ever played has come anywhere near the level of mental exertion required by the first title, and the sequel adds elements that have profound effects if you are able to integrate them.  First of all, the relatively staid World Map of the first game - the screens that are concerned with the movement of armies and recruiting - have received conceptual upgrades that make them a part of the whole experience.  You might remember that the newest Romance of the Three Kingdoms game, also from Koei, had elements I enjoyed but did not entertain me for very long.  Players familiar with both games will see immediately that the Town gameplay elements from the Romance series, things like visiting different buildings and improving your skills, all of that has not been rolled into the new Dynasty Tactics.  So instead of earning new combat skills just as you level up, each battle you win earns you experience you can then use to buy tactics.  Of course, different heroes have different stats, some stats are good for some tactics and not others, this effects the price of the abilities, and people who know each other utilize bonus tactics you can't purchase...  And they cranked up the difficulty something fierce.  At the end of the day, the sequel to Dynasty Tactics is vastly improved over its predecessor.  They'll win no converts with it - the combat system has only gotten more complex, with the addition of Tactical Chains that let single units unload their entire combat inventory on an enemy unit, like a Death Sale.    

I haven't had the time to dig into Etherlords II the way I want to - I was so agitated waiting for it to come out, and I've had too much writing to invest myself in it yet. On the weekend I've mostly been enraging myself with political blogs and playing that Goddamn Rocket Mania, I need activities that can be accomplished in the absence of sobriety and these things fit the bill.  It's one of those tile-based puzzle games like Candy Train, but it has a friendly dragon and a vaguely Asian theme that makes me feel like I'm at one of the rich cultural festivals I assume they have.  I'd recommend just starting with the deluxe version and then just switching to the free version if you don't feel like paying - it has additional game modes and will grip your consciousness like a sense memory.


We ended up doing an extra strip and post this weekend, you can find them at the aforementioned links.  We haven't had new comics on the weekend since back in the Bench days, we've done the Monday/Wednesday/Friday thing so long that doing a comic on some unauthorized day felt almost illicit.  Also, you'll find that the dress code is more lax on the weekends.     


We all went over to Brad's this weekend to fold T-Shirts, not just any T-Shirts mind you but T-Shirts that have Penny Arcade things on them.  We're just waiting on the Fruit Fuckers and the hoodies, and then it's go time.

Were you there at midnight for the N-Gage ""Midnight Madness"" event, or perhaps the slightly less prestigious but still very exciting ""Dawn Madness"" event?  The guys we've talked at the stores around here have only pre-sold two or three of them, total, it's starting to look like the only ""madness"" lies in Nokia persisting in their game phone adventure.


A truly wild confluence of events conspired to make me play Final Fantasy XI practically all day yesterday.  I'm not exactly sure why.  Gabe had asked for another access code yesterday, in the hopes that someone on the beta had played their fill already - rest assured that I was able to put one of those codes to work.  So after playing it all day, I dreamed about it all night, swords and spells, Kara backing us up with healing magic and then hitting a goblin square in the jaw with a bronze ankh.  My on again, off again love affair with the Massive genre has been well chronicled on this site, Asheron's Call, Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot, played my share of Ragnarok Online, Shattered Galaxy, another Asheron's Call, I even played Eve Online and never told anyone - I'm fascinated by the genre's social possibilities primarily, if not always the underlying game mechanics.     


The social possibilities are usually what gets me out of the games, as well.  The arc of my involvement with a game usually goes like this. 


1)  Get a new online game, play it a lot and meet some interesting people.


2)  See some those people online a couple times and really enjoy myself.  ""This is great!"" I exclaim.


3)  Something happens in real life that keeps me from logging in for a while.  This might be anything from a desperate assault on my home by black tailed tree rats to touring blues festivals under a pseudonym.  


4)  Because of my shame at missing Clan events or what have you, I never log on again.


I mean it.  This process has iterated on three separate games.  Now, this last part I could probably work on.  I'm fairly assertive in these newsposts and almost nowhere else, so owning up to why I was not at the raid is difficult for me but it's something I could get better at, probably with the help of lies.  But It's actually Gabe that got me into FFXI, I know him, and I'm used to disappointing him.  I shrug, and he scowls - that's as hard as it ever gets.     


I've played so many of these games that, really, they all sort of run together.  So as to how it compares to other games of this type, I mean, you won't be too shocked - at least, not at the lower levels where I am.  You choose the classic Jobs that are synonymous with Final Fantasy, mages of different colors, warriors, monks, and different levels of ability in these basic classes allow access to advanced classes, like the deadly ninja.  You'll cast spells with names that you have probably heard of, and eradicate adorable rabbits that bear you no ill will, even in death.  Really, all of this is just a template that rests atop the basic assumptions this genre has - do things over and over again, until you are strong enough to do them over and over again on a more powerful foe with more powerful abilities.  I'm not saying that's good or bad, I'm just putting it out there.  The thing that will keep you in this game or any other game of its ilk is the social group that binds you to it.  Either that, or OCD.

Gabe's heading out of town, going back over to Spokane to work on an article for Penny Arcade.  He also wanted me to mention that he'll be hanging out at Merlyn's on Saturday, in case you were bored, which seems all too likely there.  Spokane is a test market for eight or ten varieties of misery at any given time, the more potent depressions and existential crises that infect our nation and even the world start out in Spokane while they are tuned for maximum efficacy.   


It's too bad, then, that his absence will essentially run out the clock on the Final Fantasy XI beta we've been enjoying.  Maybe it's for the best, as we'd never actually be able to keep our progress from these borrowed accounts anyway.  On the bright side, it will give Gabe a chance to 
change his stupid name and play the Goddamn game right.  If you don't have some vaguely Celtic-sounding name going on, what is the point.  I ask you.  Next time you create a character, ask yourself:  have I used enough Y's?    


I'm going to dismantle all my stuff here for the LAN party I'll be attending this weekend, and if the four previous LAN parties are any indicator, this one will be entirely devoted to Soldier of Fortune 2.  If I had last year's We're Right awards to do over again, I'd have found a place to put SOF in there even if I had to invent a number.  I might as well just do that.  I am retroactively making Soldier of Fortune 2 number ""eleventy"" in our best games of 2002.  What makes it so Goddamned great?  Let's investigate it.


It is amazing to think that Soldier of Fortune 2 very nearly ""Focused On The Single-Player Experience,"" by which I mean ""Had No Multiplayer.""  I was going to try to list some of the good things, but that set is so large that I could save myself a lot of time by mentioning the bad things, because there's only one.  The animation for walking looks stupid.  I mean it, that's it.  When you walk, you look as though you might still have something up your ass.  I'm not omniscient, maybe that is common for Soldiers of Fortune.  I don't know.  It's not a subject I'm qualified to discuss.


Once you get past that single animation, the rest of the multiplayer experience is like the perfect word of God.  With every patch, they consistently upped the ante with great maps - even going so far as to contact Threewave to produce a few solid additions to the canon.  I honestly feel, and time may bear me out, that the maps in the second Soldier of Fortune could withstand comparisons with virtually any other game for sheer play and re-playability.  One of the patches even added a Demolition mode similar - well, identical - to the bomb mode in CS.  


Soldier of Fortune 2 had a scandalously detailed hit model, with nearly a hojillion hit locations that allowed the game to accurately render the loss of each skin layer.  It uses a scaled back version of this model in multiplayer, but even in this limited capacity it provides what is, in my opinion, the most satisfying suite of grievous injuries in gaming.  You get the impression that your activities have serious physical ramifications.  It's not just eye candy, though it's that, too.  It is a way of completing the simulation, the modern fascination with Physics Engines produces a similar result.  Essentially, the things you are doing matter.  Not in the grand scheme, but locally - say, your left elbow.  When fired upon by a shotgun at close range, there is a consequence.

Despite any ribbing we may have given the series, we're both pretty big Resident Evil fans - solved each one, and lined up happily to buy them again when the fancy versions arrived for the Cube.  We're even excited about Resident Evil Outbreak, a multiplayer variation on the game.  But when we imagine the sorts of conversations one might have with strangers while playing it, it becomes difficult to maintain that enthusiasm.


So, Max Payne will be out the fifteenth - really, really out, not ""It Will Be Out"" and then released half-way into next year.  As a person who has internalized disappointment so deeply, the idea that the hype machine only just got underway and now we'll actually have it sounds like a communique from another dimension.   I've devoured every interview and every video, new trailer included, and it looks as though Remedy has a judo hold on what a sequel should represent.  All I really wanted was a more responsive environment, and they've done it, so I guess they win.  Like the shattered bodies in Soldier of Fortune 2, I want bullets - even stray bullets - to matter in game space.  It looks like they're using Havok, as Painkiller does, and the results are nothing short of aromatic.  We certainly goofed around with Max Payne's gritty monologue style, but as I say in the post for that day I actually did enjoy it.  Taking on a romance element as they've done with the sequel, that's pretty ballsy in my opinion.  I'll be out of town on the fifteenth, most likely pining for the game.         


The first two pages - well, the cover and a page - are up for our five-page Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comic.  Please check it out, if you have a moment - and I'll let you know when they put up the other pages.  


There was a new Call of Duty demo available this weekend, Dawnville it was called, but now it's gone and you can't get it anymore.  I popped back to the desktop for a bit at the LAN party I was at, apparently in the brief window the game was available, and had no trouble getting my hands on it - it's great, like the other one is great, at any rate that's not why I brought it up.  The reason Gabe went over to Spokane at all was to show his Grandfather - a man who has never discussed his experience in World War II - the original Call of Duty demo, and talk to him about his reaction to it.  I have to admit, there is a part of me that has always wanted authorization from that generation to play these games, set as they are in their private definition of hell.       


Gabe is coming back from Spokane today, he might discuss the Crouching Tiger stuff or he might not, but I know that he had a great time at Merlyn's on Saturday.  He had planned to stay there for about an hour, but it ended up taking around three or so to get out all the sketches it sounds like.  Typically I am the Social Interface for Penny Arcade, and it might not have looked it but doing that event was pretty brave in Gabriel terms.  I have a sneaking suspicion that he did it because he thought no-one would show up.

Necrophilia?  Maybe that's going too far?  I'm actually being quite charitable.  Kevin Anderson has a body of work that exists outside Dune which I've heard is pretty good.  Brian Herbert has a famous dad.  Together, they have conspired on a book that descends below the rankest Small Wonder fan fiction, diluting the Dune Universe down to one or two parts per million.  The book itself is condescending garbage, and while it holds forth the shape and form of genuine Dune books that structure is animated with the broad, explicit motions of a puppet show.  It's clear that they read the original books, by which I mean plundered - raiding them, as tombs are raided.      


I have a sort of ridiculous announcement to make.


I'm leaving town today, in a couple hours actually, to go down to Los Angeles.  It is my understanding that there are people on the development team of NBA Ballers who wanted us to come down for their release party.  We have a considerable affection for...  I'm not sure what he genre is called, exactly.  Urban is just a code word.  Hip-Hop Basketball games?  I'm not sure.  At any rate, we had a marked NBA Street 2 phase, where we would pass the right kind of rock and otherwise manipulate a lexicon we have only a passing familiarity with.  We aren't indifferent to that type of game.  Also, I'm sort of honored that they would want me there.  But you need to understand that the gravity in my apartment is almost ten times that of the surrounding area.  It's pronounced.  So there had to be something else to get me down there, some accoutrement, like the first phase of a space rocket.  Here it is:      


They are going to thug me out.


That's right.  There will be a dresser on-hand, apparently, to adorn humans with jerseys and bling and what have you.  And Gabe just got back from Spokane, he's not going anywhere.  I can't describe how far outside my comfort zone the situation is - but I have a hunger for uncomfortable situations.  Like stories about Cowboy Killers or Bible Camp, I hope that my discomfort will provide you with much amusement.  Also, with John Romero recently becoming a part of the Midway Family, there is a chance I might see him there.  Rowrr.       


I had a chance to listen to the tape of Gabe's interview with his granddad, and it's already harrowing.  They touch on the new Vietnam games very briefly, and without going into much detail he wasn't crazy about the idea.  My stepdad was in Vietnam, as I would imagine many dads were - step or otherwise.  If he'll talk to me, and I wouldn't blame him if he didn't, but if he did, I'll ask him what it's like to have someone make a toy out of your best friend dying in a jungle.

I was desperate for information about Max Payne 2, so I called Gabe the moment they would let me turn my cell phone back on.  He's already bored, finds the action listless and repetitive, and really, really wants Max Payne to Shut Up.  I grabbed it just to see for myself.  Who knows what that reflex is - to see another man disgusted by something, and say to yourself, ""I want some of that."" 


After playing it myself, I understand the issue.  Max Payne 2 is not really a different game from the first Max Payne.  I'll deal with the narrative in a moment, but game-wise it is virtually identical.  So if you were already sick of Max Payne before it ended, like Gabe was, then you will be sick of Max Payne 2 even before it starts.  We certainly have what they are calling Bullet-Time 2.0, which is by all accounts a very nice Bullet-Time, but you will not be unfamiliar with it.  In addition to a color-change effect, this new bullet-time allows you to reload almost instantaneously - very nice for a sawed-off, with its two-shot payload.  You might have seen this spin thing Max does in videos of the game, and that's what he's doing.  Bullet-time also ramps up in effectiveness as you extinguish human life which is great for all you effectiveness fans out there.  I would liken the original Max Payne to a tuna fish sandwich.  If you have had your fill of tuna fish sandwiches, you will not find the sandwich any more appetizing if they bring you another tuna fish sandwich with a fancy deli toothpick in it.       


I craved the first game, and only recently reinstalled it to get back in the mood.  I loved the first Max Payne with the unwavering, bulletproof love I have for all kittens.  It's intense and very masculine.  So when I install the new one and see environments crafted with adoration and a sense of architecture, I see textures and models that are just sick, and I shoot a man into a shelf which then collapses, I get the same feeling I had before back - the good feelings I remembered.  The graphical improvements, what I call fancy deli toothpicks, would be hard to overstate.  I will stand by a light sometimes and just move around to see the shine on the coat.      


The story that bores Gabe so intensely I am thus far perfectly satisfied with, but admittedly I wasn't expecting much.  I've participated in a few fairly strange interactive cutscenes that are far less self-indulgent and more involving than the ones from the first game, I am satisfied that they have matured their storytelling technique based on what I've seen thus far.  I think I'll go play it some more.  


The tools for Max Payne 2 will be out shortly, God willing we'll get another Kung-Fu mod to enjoy the game with on the higher levels.


Having just returned from the NBA Ballers blingathon, the experience was psychotic enough that I can't depict it at the moment.  If it is in my power to depict the scenario in a way you might find interesting I will do so come Monday.


Also, I'd read on WinInformant before I left that iTunes for Windows was imminent, and sure enough it's there now.  I keep hearing it's holy or whatever.

196,2003-10-20,I am an artist!,"
Today’s comic strip hits very close to home. I’ve become increasingly interested in Apple products over the last few months and the recent release of itunes has only fueled the fire. As an artist I feel like I am letting the other artists down by not working on a Mac. I look at their products and I begin to salivate, as if I’d been hungry all my life but until that moment I never understood what food was. I tell myself that I would be more creative if I used a Mac. That it’s graceful lines would somehow awake in me a level of artistry that had been sitting dormant all these long years. 

I had recently decided that while I could not justify the astronomical expense associated with purchasing a new Apple G5 I could justify getting one of their Monitors. My plan is to purchase one of their cinema displays along with the adaptor they make that allows it to work with my pedestrian PC. The hope being of course that this would be enough to satisfy the artist in me that so desperately craves the Apple experience.

I tend to do a fairly decent job of keeping the artist side of myself in check. I do this for the benefit of the people I hang out with more than anything. I know that I usually dislike creative people. For the most part they tend to be assholes. I know that the same potential for narcissism and haughtiness lies within me. I have on occasion been invited to gatherings where these “creative types” congregate. It’s the sort of place where you are likely to bump into the bass player for your favorite promising local band or a girl wearing a Playboy T-shirt even though her antipathy for the publication is well known (isn’t the irony delicious?). When I see these people it’s like I’m looking into some kind of fun house mirror. I can see how easily my own personality could be slightly pinched or stretched to produce the same characteristics. I tend to find these events terrifying unless there are video games handy.

After High school I was accepted into Cornish school of the arts. My portfolio review with them was a real eye opener. Seated in front of a panel of six or seven professors I was grilled about my artwork. My portfolio at the time consisted almost entirely of comic book super heroes and cartoon characters. One professor told me that he could see the same caliber of work by examining the margins of any 9th graders algebra notes. They all agreed that I had “potential” though and decided to allow me into their school under the assumption that I would of course focus on doing “real art” as opposed to the crap I had been producing up to that point. I toured the campus and saw the sorts of people that go there and the sort of work they produce. I realized that I was not like them. I decided not to attend the most prestigious art school in Washington and instead went to community college for a few years. I made no attempt to acquire any sort of degree. I simply spent my days in the art building taking the sorts of classes I was interested in. Figure drawing, color and design, pottery and a few others. The teachers there encouraged my cartooning. My figure drawing teacher did not try and tell me that comic book characters were a waste of time. Instead she told me that before I could exaggerate the human form I needed to learn how to represent it accurately. Obviously now looking back I’m glad I decided to stick to my guns and focus on cartooning. It seems to have worked out pretty well for me.

So it’s not often that I allow the artist side of myself to really come out. This whole Apple thing is one of the few occasions. The artist inside me absolutely craves one. The other part of me though happens to be the part that controls the check book, and it says no fucking way.

We are both extremely fond of Jak II, and though we might try to associate a number with our enjoyment there is no number in all of imagination to describe it.  To look at it, the urban hub (for example) dense with vehicles, activity, and raw polygons, it gives one the impression that Naughty Dog has discovered some secret processor in the machine - hidden, perhaps, under one of the other ones.  I can run around from hell to breakfast, over diverse zones stealing hoverbikes and flying across towns, and I never see a loading screen while I look at amazing graphics and have fun braving their innovations in the tried and true platform style of gameplay.  Like all platform games, it skirts the credible with its ridiculous, useless machines and convenient dangers.     


Also, um...  We didn't actually continue the last comic.  I know why you would think we might continue it, because in the last panel it says ""To Be Continued"" and it doesn't really resolve itself.  We never really intended to go on from there, as it basically stands on its own - Gabe is sort of switching teams, the whole thing is vaguely homoerotic and that's basically it.  If you wanted to call that an ""inside joke,"" there's no way I could get snippy with you.  Unfinished jokes and lies are probably an acquired taste, humor-wise. 


Gabe rarely indulges himself as he did on Wednesday, detailing the parameters of his artist identity.  This is because he is only pretentious about one thing, that being his lack of pretension, and even discussing it breaks a cardinal rule.  I know a secret, though, and I'm going to tell it to you.  I know that he nearly gave up drawing altogether.  Oh, it might have peeked out sometimes, as from behind a tree, when using the crayons at the tacky Italian restaurant he would impress the waitress with a picture of salt and pepper shakers dancing.  But I mean that he would never actually harbor the insane, fruitless dream of living by what he drew.


People always ask us how Penny Arcade started, and it's the ""Entered a contest and lost, started running at Loonygames"" bit that has a populist appeal.  People rarely ask about the next part, though they sometimes do, the part where Jason Bergman from Loonygames started telling us how to write the comic and, in a makeshift flying machine like those confiscated in communist East Germany, we escaped to servers hosted by Old Man Murray.  There's some takers for that part.  But there's no takers for the very next period of the strip, probably because newposts of the period make most of our operation public, but it's the most important part because that's where most strips find themselves.  They're simply doing the best they can from update to update.  At that point, I'm working regular human hours during the day and consulting at night, and he's starting work in the middle of the day and getting home at eleven or one, depending on whether or not he had to climb in the scaffolding for inventory.  Then, you know...  Tribes.  So we'd write the strips in the early morning, and he would draw them, and after about a year of this it exhausted him.     


Not because the physical act of drawing is tiring, although I guess that's not something I have any knowledge of.  I think that Penny Arcade had become, for him, emblematic of his life as a person who creates things.  I think that he looked forward and saw his entire life like that - populated with ten or twelve hour days that culminated in him up all night trying to maintain the spark of creation, trying to remember what it felt like to make things.  As he began to withdraw, I had reserves enough to fill in.  But something clearly needed to be done.


Penny Arcade was making some money at this point, I think it was a few hundred dollars a month.  Remember that this was the heyday of the Internet, and during that period a few hundred bucks was the same as nothing - ""Content Aggregators"" like UGO were signing sites to exclusive contracts and paying then with sports cars.  And there were multiple UGO's, roving the Internet, picking up sites whose traffic had spiked high even once.  We had actively avoided places like that on purpose, we just had a fear of them, and so we joined a small one that was unaffiliated with any of the big fish.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when a big fish then bought them, but that's a whole 'nother story.  


Something I want to communicate to people doing comics on the web is that you would be truly shocked to find out how little a person can live on if they can cultivate a taste for Top Ramen.  Instead of each taking half of the proceeds of the site, I let him have my half.  As I type this now, the whole thing seems kind of petty even though at the time it seemed like a matter of life and death.  It was certainly a matter of Life and Death for Penny Arcade, I suppose.  But we aren't like the hero in the movie who feigns weariness and actually has unlimited stamina.  We are ordinary human beings with ordinary reserves of physical strength, and the idea that you could somehow support yourself with a comic strip about videogames was preposterous, so why shouldn't we just play videogames instead?  Maybe Penny Arcade was, like Sand, Chickenman, Gen13, Scythe, or Clouds, a project we loved desperately but was an unlimited void for us to pour our affection into.  I needed to prove to him that Penny Arcade, and, by extension, his art wasn't just some fucking hobby or void or anything like that.  I needed to prove to him that it does work out, sometimes, even though I had to make it not work for me order to do that.  It seems like things eventually turned out alright.

You can see our friend Robert there in today's strip, at least, I think he's still our friend.  Of course, you also see Gabe.  But when is that anything to celebrate?    


I had just come back from American Splendor, a movie I recommend to every writer but also to every reader, essentially every literate person.  I felt like I had lived an entire life during my time in the theater, it was like that episode of TNG.  At any rate. 


When I got home, I had six or seven calls from Gabe, even going up to eleven o'clock.  He's a night owl, but he has very strict rules he observes about calling people then - essentially, the rules say he can't.  Maybe he had contracted some kind of disease, I thought.  I can watch him waste away. 


It turns out that he just wanted to play Crimson Skies, quite a lot I guess, call me six times at eleven o'clock a lot.  And after playing it for a while, I can understand why.  I had meant to try it online during the day yesterday, but after jumping into the Single Player mode and expecting it to be sort of corollary, inoffensive, polite but unnecessary, I ended up playing it for hours.  It's probably for the best, as I was able to come into multi not completely unaware of Airplane stuff.  The controls are a marvel of modern ergonomics, every button useful and nothing duplicated.  Combinations of analog stick movements allow wild, Blue Angels shit - graceful maneuvers designed to avoid harm or just be fancy.  To say that it is MechAssault with airplanes oversimplifies the game and doesn't give it enough credit, but that's certainly a good place to start.  You do battle with other people online, sixteen instead of MechAssault's eight, in a variety of deadly equipment.  They diverge immediately, though, with great gametypes like ""Keep Away"" or ""Flag Heist"" that only hint at what the future will reveal.  Like MechAssault, you can expect more planes, maps, and gametypes for months - but these initial offerings are ample in their own right.        


I've seen the game twice before this, three times I guess, two at E3 and once over at FASA itself.  Every time I saw it, it had improved incrementally - but the final release version is polished so far beyond earlier versions that it's inexplicable.  Try capturing a flag through twisty passages in the Lost City or cruising through canyons on Arixo after the desirable chicken in Wild Chicken mode.  There are simply no valid complaints to make about the way the game looks.  Sailing lazily over the shell of a once active volcano, the moon reflecting off the water as four bastards came in for the flag is an experience I can't overstate. 


This game has something of a storied past, nearly cancelled, wasn't meant to have online play, changed designers, there was apparently even a Mummy loose in the office at one point.  What I've got here at my house is refined, doesn't cut corners, and delivers on the promise of swashbuckling Air Piracy.  It has an entertaining, beautiful single player experience and multiplayer that is accessible and feature rich.  What I've written here sounds like hyperbole, but every person who has played it knows exactly what I mean.

Page three of our Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon comic is available. Things really kick into gear on this page with some cool action. I had a decision to make about how I would treat the Green Destiny. In the movies it’s essentially just a kick ass sword. In the comics it’s a magical kick ass sword that spouts green fire and creates spinning vortexes of doom. I decided it would be more fun to use the Green Destiny from the comics. If you liked our CTHD comic, I highly recommend picking up the mini series done by Andy Seto. 


There is one page of CTHD left and I assume that will pop up sometime next week. I’ll be starting work on our next project tomorrow. It’s another five page comic based on a game. No swords or horses in this one, but you might see some flash bangs.

We had considered doing another Crimson Skies comic, but determined that we've probably said everything already.  It really is remarkable and has no right being as good as it is.  I would put last night's Flag Heist match on Windy City up against almost any other multiplayer game experience I've had.  Picture eight planes flying through the rain, in a map that consists of the tops of skyscrapers that poke up through the cloud layer.  ""Jaunty"" Jack Burton and SixSidedDie coming for the flag, Gabe and I on D as LCDXX and BreakmanX tried to come back with it.  If you have Live, please give the game a try - shit, it comes with two free months of Live play, maybe you'd be sick of it by then anyhow.  Who knows.       


So, Crimson is the game I'm playing with other people.  There's also a fair bit of Desert Combat going on.  By my lonesome, I sometimes jump on to the Halo demo and try to figure out whether or not I like it.  I don't have the performance issues that I often read about, at least not graphically, but the networking on that game is really, really variable.  You can play on a server that makes you wonder what they were thinking even putting it out one minute and then get on something smooth that reminds you of late-night Xbox LANs on Blood Gulch.  The ping doesn't seem to indicate shit.  It would be like if the server browser had a column for ""Mint"" and then some servers had it and some servers didn't.  Ping is like that in Halo PC.  I have no idea what it is supposed to represent, and even if I did know I wouldn't know how to detect the presence of that quality in a first person shooter.  It might be best to focus your time on dedicated servers, as you would in Battlefield, but there's never been a slot open on one of those since the demo was released.


My special, personal Tycho time is spent with Etherlords II, and even typing its name makes my heart pirouette.  It's like being able to play the collectible card games that I crave without any of the guilt associated with harvesting healthy young livers to pay for them.    


One last thing:  Neil has cracked out a new version of his PAINT app, the Penny Arcade Internet Notification Tool.  It has so many new features that if you used the old one or would simply like to know when we make posts, it's probably best for you just to go and get it.

During the beta for Final Fantasy XI, we felt the exquisite new pleasures that had been designed by SquareSoft.  Yes, it's pretty much an MMORPG, no, aside from fantastic art direction there isn't all that much to distinguish it, but as I said in a related post I play these games basically as a way to hang out.  Once I learned that 



your starting server is completely random, 



that people must earn money in game to bring friends to their server by buying a World Pass,



that the amount of money you need to earn depends on how populated your server is, 



that they aren't opening any new servers for the US launch which will inflate the price across the board, 



and that even once you do get a World Pass from a friend it doesn't let you bring an existing character, you have to create a new one who won't be of comparable level to the person that brought you over there in the first fucking place, 



the whole thing is stupid and I'm not their accountant, they can come up with some other way to load balance their servers if we're going to pay thirteen dollars a month for the privilege of frustration. 


The US release apparently allows you to bring five people over instead of the original one, which doesn't really fix the problem - it just downgrades it from ""absolutely insane"" to ""pretty ridiculous.""  In our rage, we even produced a comic on the subject.  If I wanted to play with myself, I have a game that doesn't cost anything.    
    
The thing is, at this very moment and realistically up until next year I don't have to put up with decisions like that.  Have you looked at the Goddamn release list for the next seven days?  The new Tony Hawk hits, kill.switch, Gladius, Top Spin, Rainbow Six 3, um...  Quidditch, Call of Duty, Thief III, Fire Emblem, and God knows what else.  I don't have to tolerate things like World Passes if I don't want to.  I can simply amuse myself with the eruption of holiday titles and someone else can maintain the price of SquareEnix stock.

203,2003-10-31,Sin City Sketchbook: Vol.1,"
Flying into Las Vegas made me realize that all other complaints I have made regarding turbulence were wild exaggerations, uncorroborated by reality.  I'm not sure this pilot had ever flown before.  I have never in my life felt motions like this, the plane tracing complex pictograms in some devil's language.  Kara suggested that I have a mint, which she said would help, and I tried to imagine how a piece of candy would improve the impact and subsequent explosion of the aircraft.  She was right, though.  I closed my eyes and focused on the taste of it, that coordinate in the living universe, and fashioned for myself a green world prior to the invention of planes.


Hello from Las Vegas.  I'm sorry that this is late, but I thought they would have some kind of internet solution at our hotel which proved foolhardy.


We have produced for you a comic which concerns our first night here, and is sketched according to ancient con traditions.  I really like to gamble, a lot, I am almost positive I have some sort of untreated disorder.  Always before it has been slots, and it was slots again last night.  Tonight, though, I'm ready to try my hand at losing the real money.  Everybody always sends you down here with their own illicit, homebrewed mechanism for gambling success - lucky machines, rituals, etcetera.  I don't know if you've ever seen the Las Vegas strip, heaped itself like a buffet with faux cultures and obscene proclamations of wealth and grandeur.  I'm just saying it's not hard to tell who has the winning strategy around here.  


For some reason, I had thought of this place and geekery as exclusive propositions, but I don't think that's really borne out.  For one thing, like creatures at the cracks in the bottom of the sea, our people can survive in the harshest conditions.  I see arcades here frequently, and even if they're just to occupy children while daddy bets their home they serve our purpose.  Obviously, a comic convention out here will produce a sort of geek algae bloom - but one thing I have heard spoken of with consistent affection is the Star Trek Experience and Quark's Bar.  I'd link you to those things, but I don't have internet access - I'm sure you understand.  At any rate, the ""Experience"" is a ride that I imagine is similar conceptually to Star Tours.  Quark's Bar is, of course, a recreation of the establishment in Deep Space Nine, finest of all Trek Series.            


I hope to see you at this thingy we're at, although I realize that Las Vegas might be somewhat out of the way - look for us in the 900's, near the end, right by Dumbrella.  My heart is sick with the thought of all those releases while we're over here, should you remain at home I need you to play Call Of Duty online in my stead.  Something tells me I'm asking the right group of people.

Man, where to even start.  Maybe with the comic?  I don't know.  Also, I'm sorry the strip went up late again.  We couldn't get it uploaded at the hotel before we had to get to the airport, and I was hoping this airport would have the wireless shit but no dice.  I'm sure we still beat Kurtz.          


At the other cons we've been to, even the Kansas City con, it's certainly slow sometimes but we are usually meeting a lot of people over the course of it.  We were situtated right by the Dumbrella guys, and this sort of feng shui at any other convention would have produced fairly startling results.  Total, over the course of three days, I saw (I'm gonna say) 58 people.  That's not an exaggeration, that is actually the best estimate I can produce.  Many vendors are joining together into some kind of class-action lawsuit, so shitty was the attendance.

     
So, con-wise, it was a bust.  We had a fun panel, saw some great fights at VGO's Soul Calibur 2 tourney and that was about it.  We gave away more shirts than we sold.  Then, when I thought it had surely reached some heretofore only theorized threshhold of boredom, a reader shattered the screen on my Hiptop.  Every now and then I would work the buttons and gaze into the mute screen, seeking answers. 


The best night was probably Saturday, and I don't just mean the best night in Las Vegas, I mean the best night that ever happened.  I can remember looking out at my friends wishing that I would just evaporate, be annhilated so that no future moment of pain or inconvenience would ever diminish it.  Of course, I'm talking about Star Trek.


So, they have this Star Trek ride in the Hilton that is pretty fun.  You might go at some point, so I'm not going to say anything about it except that they're changing it soon, so you better go if you want to see it the way it is now.  At any rate, after we left there they had a restaurant fashioned after Quark's Bar where a fierce Klingon was reading Star Trek trivia questions while you order things like The eternal Chicken Continuum, or the vengeful Wrap of Khan.  After we sat down, the Klingon (Vo'Qha) came over to our table and introduced himself gruffly, assuring us that he was here on a diplomatic mission which relieved us.  


This is about the point that things took a turn.


I think that every person who worked there knew who we were.  Three rounds of ""James Tea Kirks"" hit us in rapid succession, like body blows.  A large fishbowl filled with rum and dry ice, a ""Warp Core Breach,"" further lubricated the event.  Then another one of those came.  After a few more rounds of trivia Vo'Qha and his cadre came back to speak with us some more, never dropping character.  He said that he would come to visit us later in ""Holographic Disguise,"" and we tried to come up with some Star Trek way to ask him if he was coming to the con or not.  He came back out as Paul later and introduced Raul, Jeff, and Darren, who (along with Lisa Lotruglio, who couldn't be there) were the architects of the festive atmosphere we were experiencing.  I know it's just some tourist thing, arguably the entire town is.  The difference is that everyone there tried so hard to maintain the right mood - thier affection for Trek actually rekindled my own.  We have photos that enunciate just how festive the event became.  To say that a lap dance occurred would not be a lie.  Anyway, I just wanted to thank those guys so much for making this stupid bullshit convention worth coming to.  


Some other stuff happened, we stole a bike, threw stuff at the Dumbrella guys for a while, that sort of thing.  If I can come up with an interesting way to put it, I'll let you know.  Now, I'm going to sleep.

The only explanation I can give for today’s comic strip is that I had, until this weekend never had a drink of alcohol before in my life. I have talked before at great length about my various neuroses so this should come as no shock. Essentially I am in a constant state of terror whenever trying anything new or doing anything outside of my routine. Even something like going out with my friends was enough to get my worry gland working over time. People always said I should just have a few drinks and loosen up. Of course they did not understand that I was also afraid of drinking. I always felt like I needed to keep my wits about me should the unexpected happen. Please do not ask me what the unexpected is as I do not know…I suppose that is why it’s unexpected. Just going to Vegas was a huge deal for me and then taking a cab ride away from the relative safety of our hotel and into the wild Las Vegas night was enough to send me into a tizzy. I went through the ride and as I was sitting down with all my friends I felt ridiculous. Here I was in this awesome place with some of my best friends who were all having the time of their lives and I was counting the cash in my wallet over and over again making sure I would have enough money for a cab ride home. This was not how I wanted to spend the evening. So when they brought out the first “Warp Core Breach” I decided it was time to enjoy myself. By the time they brought out the first wave of shots there was no turning back. I didn’t get drunk but I drank enough to get rid of the fucking worry that usually accompanies an evening out in a strange place. I can not even begin to describe what a good time I had. I’m not in any hurry to drink again but at least I’m not afraid of it anymore.

Playing the excellent SSX3 just made me angrier.  This feud between EA and Microsoft has got to stop.  It's hurting the kids.  


When it was just regular sports games, I didn't really care.  I wasn't running out there half-dressed to get a copy of Madden, got to get that Madden.  The fact that their games only supported two players was silly in some cases, illustrated best by Tiger Woods 2004 (where they simply don't allow you to play the more interesting modes) and Nascar Thunder 2004 (race with as many as...  one other driver).  When they say Head To Head play, let's be clear - they mean only two heads.  But when they started releasing what were essentially neutered forms of games, excising multiplayer co-op in Return of the King and Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, or leaving out multiplayer altogether in SSX3, I just flipped out.  Every console has exclusives.  I expect that.  While multiplatform games provide at least the illusion of choice, antics like this completely pierce that notion.  The Xbox and Gamecube versions are incomplete.           


It was easy to think of EA's offering and Microsoft's offering as fungible initially.  EA was doing theirs for free, and Microsoft had a pay service, and obviously free is...  nice.  But while I was being desiccated by Las Vegas nights soaked with alcohol, it seemed to me that their service is free because it sucks.  It's free because it is so without ambition that it can be offered for nothing, until such time as they want to charge for it.  Why else would they reserve the right, why else would they go through all the trouble?      


I've spent enough time on Live with recent titles that it's impossible for me to compare the two approaches.  You don't sign in to Live, you don't create a password, you push A.  Every game supports voice and a universal friends list I can view from the web.  I have a hard disk built in for content.    There is an ethernet port.  That's not so you can put a jelly bean in there in case you need it later, it's so you can put in a cable and access the Internet.  You assholes.  


That is all to say nothing about game invites.  If I'm playing a game by Ubi Soft, I can still receive invites to play games from other developers - each publisher doesn't have it's own little fairy land where I can only play games with other people who have their games.  I can be playing Crimson Skies and get an invite to play Ghost Recon.  If I say yes, the tray pops out and I put in the other disc.  Then, it joins me automatically.  When I can do that with games from EA, I'll shut the fuck up.  Until then, they need to act like big people and make choices that are of value to consumers.   


When grabbing True Crime and Call of Duty yesterday, sweet Call Of Duty, they finally had a copy of Final Fantasy XI around - and based on a couple conversations I've had, I decided to take the plunge.  I said some things that certainly seemed accurate from my position, and I certainly haven't flip-flopped and started thinking that World Passes are just awesome, but there are ways to mediate the inconveniences and still extract the fun. 


Talking to a SquareEnix guy at Las Vegas, he let me know that just creating your character at about the same time can often get you set up on the same server.  I haven't tried it yet, obviously the other way is to just keep creating characters over and over again until you get it right, like a reverse Russian Roulette.  That doesn't sound like my idea of fun, so I'd try technique one first.  Also, apparently the price for a World Pass was reduced for the US version, which helps - a friend of mine put in the time over the weekend and earned the 875 gil required on his server, primarily by selling crafting items directly to players in Auctions.  This same friend also took me to task for highlighting the level differences between the person who earned the World Pass and the people they bring in, as the multiclassing system in Final Fantasy XI is almost perfectly suited to this problem.  Got some friends coming to your world?  Switch classes to something the party will need, and start leveling up in another discipline.  You'll keep your skills and hit points, but you'll have some early level work to do mastering your new abilities.  I mainly wanted to establish all this because I feared I'd scared people away that might have otherwise enjoyed it.  These techniques aren't perfect, but some combination thereof will certainly suffice. 


Now, I need to go meet Pork in the line for the movie.  We saw Matrix Reloaded at the Imax a few months ago, and apparently it did so well that they decided to open Matrix Revolutions the same day as they do in your mortal theaters.  Around here, the cost to see a movie on a regular screen and the cost to see it on a screen the size of God is pretty much the same, so it's hard to understand why you wouldn't.  It's showing at Six In The Morning, and Pork mentioned that people had started to line up last night at seven so he's been there all Goddamn night in a bone chilling pantomime of the PS2 launch.  I'm going to bring him something hot to drink, and then commence suffering myself.  God Damn the person who started that line, God Damn them a thousand times.

Our crew is playing Call of Duty now at night and I just had a quick comment about how the search and destroy mode works. It’s fucking lame. So the objective is to go and blow up the German shit, which is cool. The problem is that if the Germans defuse the bomb the game ends and the Germans win. Even if there are allies still alive and time on the clock the game is over and you lose. This is really stupid. If the Germans defuse the charge and I am still alive and kicking I should have the opportunity to plant again or keep kicking ass. I can understand if only one soldier had the ability to plant and he was killed, but everyone on the team can plant explosives. Either way it’s really frustrating and doesn’t make any sense. Our entire crew agrees that they need to at least make it a setting you can turn on or off.

Short an issue I'll go into in a moment, which isn't even really an issue but more of a semantic distinction, Call Of Duty Multiplayer takes us straight back to the fun we had playing Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault.  We jumped from Wolf to MOHAA not because Medal was better as a game necessarily, and it ran pretty rough sometimes.  We made the switch because it evoked its cinematic heritage with such precision.  Call of Duty does it too, and it's no wonder, seeing as it's virtually the same team that made it.  With four nationalities and their respective armaments lovingly realized, not to mention a suite of fully twelve maps to play the team-based modes, it occupies my thoughts constantly.  I had the opportunity to speak with a couple guys from the team during production, and the enthusiasm for their project was obvious.  If I were Activision, I'd have bought them too.  I would also say things like ""Look at my new developer"" or ""Isn't my new developer nice.""


I do echo Gabe's thoughts regarding the Search And Destroy mode.  It's far from a dealbreaker where CoD is concerned, and I've played enough Counter-Strike to expect demolition-style gameplay to work the way he describes, but if anybody can plant the bomb they should just let them.  When half the team is still alive with full health, but some jackass has run off and planted a bomb he has no hope of protecting it's sort of frustrating to lose a round.  I've read in interviews that the gametypes are easy to code up, via perfectly visible scripts that even a cat could master.  They'll either take it into their own hands, or we'll start seeing a Search and Destroy v2.0 homebrew at virtually any moment. 

Via my vast network of secret contacts, I have had an opportunity to play final code on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, and I want to warn people that they are going to see some extremely high numbers associated with this title.  I'm tempted to just call it Game of the Year and just get it over with.  What I've played on demo discs and already raved about is garbage compared to the final version, which you'll see in stores this month.  The visuals are stylish and extremely accomplished, a universal glow effect cements you squarely in the legendary context.  The ability to rewind time in limited amounts gives you a second chance on that tricky jump you should have made, and even as a single player game it logs into Xbox Live and lets you receive game requests.

Also, a game that could not be more dissimilar from Desert Combat - Karaoke Revolution - should be in stores today as well.  Though Konami is publishing it, it's actually by Harmonix - a.k.a.

Karaoke Revolution is pretty good.  When you play it by yourself, it's better than doing than dishes.  Get a couple people over, and - like Mario Party or Super Smash - something alchemical occurs.  Even singing ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" becomes a carnival of self-aware amusement.  


We finally started playing Final Fantasy XI on Sunday, and let me tell you that it felt good.  We took a break midday, and still consumed by enthusiasm I scraped message boards and the like for answers to my searing questions.  This is the good part, the best part perhaps of the Massive experience.  New game mechanisms spread out into the obscured distance, each time I log in struck by some peculiar newness.  A man rides by the river on a Chocobo.  Our party of three is eradicated by a creature we have dubbed The Omega Rabbit.  A tall elf runs at top speed toward the city, pursued by two mushrooms.        


Since I am usually a little more excited about a game than the people I'm playing it with, I appreciate a fairly involved crafting system to occupy me while they're logged out.  Unfortunately, the beta concluded before I had a chance to really get into that side of it.  FFXI has a system that is similar to other games - take a look at Warcry's recipe list, you combine items like you would in any other game of this type.  The way it differentiates itself from the others is that in order to actually combine the proper items, you need something to catalyze it.  You use a variety of crystals for that purpose.


You can buy crystals at the Auction house, where players put up items and the bidding begins.  There's typically people knelt down outside the auction house as well, and if you see a pouch near their name it means they have selected items from their inventory that are available for purchase.  Sometimes they're getting rid of crystals, but it's mostly like a medieval garage sale where characters pawn off stuff they don't need anymore.  The most straightforward way to get crystals - and recall that there are several kinds, with a variety of effects - is to ask the gatekeeper for your nation's ""Signet.""  When he casts it on you, along with regular treasure items you will sometimes receive crystals of different types.  You can use these for your own projects, or you can bundle them up and sell them at auctions or whatever else.  As near as I can tell, these catalyzing agents form the basis of the economy.  


Wow, I'll bet you're glad I talked about that for so long.  I'm kind of fucking fixated right now.  I'm chewing my teeth with the anticipation of my next login. 


It's already to the point where you have to carefully meter each gaming moment, and that's before this week's releases - X2: The Threat, Contract J.A.C.K., and Uru on PC, Mario Party 5 and then Mario Kart coming up at the end of the week for the Cube, Links 2004 on Xbox, Ratchet and Clank II on PS2, and then the multiplatform stuff like the new Legacy Of Kain or Prince of Persia.  Speaking of the Prince, there is a perfectly tolerable article about its completion over at Gamespot.  And though it seems strange to think of it, Links 2004 may well supplant the action-oriented fare we've been dining on of late.

211,2003-11-12,The Omega Hare," 
Like a prophet, I foretold the arrival of the Omega Hare - literally, ""The Hare Who Ends.""  But when you get on a roll out there in East Ronfaure, and you're about twenty times larger than the beast in question, you might neglect to examine your foe.  That is when he will strike.    


I'm almost certain we overdid it this weekend, devoting almost two entire days to Final Fantasy XI.  I'll admit that during the beta, I saw the game as a decent enough Massive title that had a high change of amusing my friends and I.  There is also a chance that I thought it was as blatant a manifestation of Avarice as I have ever seen in electronic entertainment.  I'm starting to wonder if I didn't give the game enough credit.  Yes, it's emasculating to be laid low by a rabbit.  Paying ten dollars a month to experience it implies that I am managing some kind of self-esteem deficit.  I'm starting to think the game is actually pretty good!  Something that is incidental to the game itself but still very useful to the average player is that this game has already been out for a while, having already been released in Japan.  The chernobyls that accompany Massive launches are so numerous they need not be enumerated here, I think the hard drive on the server is only eighty gigs.  But when an entire nation has playtested the game before it ever sees your store shelf, it's reasonable to expect a smooth ride.  Aside from some interface issues that have more to do with its console heritage than peculiar design, Final Fantasy XI is a clean experience that is technically accomplished, easy on the eye and painless to recommend.          


You might recall that shortly before I left for Italia where olive-skinned charlatans hit on your wife while you are right there, I wrote a bit about Uru: Ages Beyond Myst - somehow managing to unite enthusiasm and despair in the same breath.  You might feel the same way as you travel though the recently released demo.  This is what happens when you let artists run the company.  I actually feel a pain in my chest when I think about the people responsible for this game eating what is left in the tunafish can after someone throws it away, piles of Uru boxes forming an improvised shelter.  Don't get me wrong, I almost cried as I played it.  I really don't agree with the third person/platform type game elements, I think that was inadvisable, but whatever.  As a multiplayer experience - just as I said before - I don't know if there will be any takers, but there is nothing like Uru.  I felt dread, real dread in parts of the demo, because they have mastered the creation of interactive spaces which seem to live.  I doubt I was in any danger, I doubt that the game even has a way to represent player death.  Will people subscribe to the game, allowing an advanced social experience and new puzzle worlds, for an additional cost?  I honestly don't know if there's a precedent.  I just want to believe that it could work.     


One last thing - I know that some of you checked out that ObjectDock software, useful because it staves off the purchase of a Macintosh at least for a short while.  The savings in the short term really are considerable.  There's a new version over at the main site that resolves a few of the issues that have been reported, most importantly for me the one where your clock stops updating.  I don't want to say I've been late to stuff because of it but I've been late to just about fucking everything.

As the title makes clear, these words are not for saying.  We don't all have time daggers, let alone magic sand, in fact neither of those things are real.   


The actual Prince of Persia never engages in misogyny, not even for a second!  He mostly runs and jumps.  This in and of itself wouldn't be noteworthy if it weren't some of the finest running and jumping that ever occurred on a television screen.  The game is so good it's almost impolite to release it, and there is a real chance it could discourage other developers.  I'm all for that.  If your game doesn't look as good, play as good, or just feel as good against my bare skin maybe it should never see the retail shelf.  There's also the fact that the people who made it were hard-bitten bad-asses.  Read this feature about the project over at Gamespot - they made the entire game on a pirate ship at sea, having legendary adventures and dealing with adversity as they learned the true meaning of friendship.  They each have a special power and one of them - we know not which - is said to be a lost heir.   


As a gamer, I feel constant satisfaction as I do battle in the most stylish combat system ever.  But as an Internet Demagogue, it pleases me that I can recommend every version of Prince of Persia for every platform.  They all look completely excellent and play right.  You can make your decision based on which system you have, which controller you prefer, if you need HDTV resolutions, whatever, and not on whether or not Electronic Arts is going to fuck you up the ass for not using their preferred platform.    


Gabe is extremely busy at the moment, but I know that he loves you.  If he could be here, he would tell you that Links 2004 is a supernatural golf experience that is a feast for the senses.  I had typed up this whole thing about the round we played yesterday, but you wouldn't believe how incredibly boring it is to describe a round a golf.  It just went on and on and on.  When we were actually playing, I couldn't breathe it was so exciting.  But reading about it was like reading about crochet, which had a brief surge of popularity in the early nineties.  Sadly, even innovations like the ""stitch-cam"" couldn't make it palatable to a mass audience.     


I have felt somewhat bad for constantly discussing Final Fantasy XI when the large preponderance of you probably couldn't give a fuck about it one way or the other.  Hopefully some portion of it has amused you.  So anyway, I'm LEVEL EIGHT.     


I think maybe I should go.

213,2003-11-15,I'm still here,"
Tycho is right, I have been super busy lately. Any free time I’ve had has been spent on games though and I wanted to share my thoughts on a few of them.

Mario Kart:DD - It’s interesting. Playing the single player was no fun at all. The tracks are kind of boring and most of them are really short and uninspired. Playing cooperatively with Kara though was fun. The new dual rider system works really well. The player on the back handles the attacking as well as helping out on power slides. The driver, well he pretty much just drives. You can switch it up at any time though and that makes for some fun maneuvers. The new power slide feature is a nice addition. I have to say I like it better than the hopping in previous games. By fiddling with the control stick during a drift you can get a little boost around corners. Next week we are gonna try a Lan game with two Cubes and more people. I’m thinking that should be pretty fun. I think Gamespot gave the game a 7.9 or something like that. If I was in the business of applying numbers to subjective experiences, I think that’s about what I’d give it.

While I was at Nintendo I also picked up Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga for the GBA. I’ve only got about an hour and a half in it but it’s pretty cool. It’s actually really funny, which is something Nintendo has a hard time pulling off . It’s got a fair mix of action and RPG elements. The role playing stuff is pretty basic though. If you are looking for something a little more in depth I’d recommend Fire Emblem which I grabbed before we took off for Vegas. Since no one came to the convention I actually got to play it quite a bit. The best way to describe it is FF:Tactics Advance meets Advance Wars.  It’s more linear than both those games though, with a very good story that takes you from battle to battle. Be ready for a lot of reading though, this game is heavy on the dialogue. Thankfully most of it is actually pretty interesting.

I got Links 2004 yesterday and played a few rounds online. It’s just as good as I hoped it would be. I’m excited to try out XSN and see how that works. Tycho and I won six grand off a couple guys last night in a two on two best ball skins game. I can’t wait until Microsoft figures out some way to let me use the money I earn beating people in Links on real shit like games or candy. 

I also got Prince of Persia. We should just save everyone a lot of time and give these guys game of the year right now. Hell give them game of the last five years. It’s one of the best games ever made. I put it right up there with REZ and ICO. Unfortunately it doesn’t have a three letter title which sort of ruins my theory. I guess I can stop development on WEX now. 

I got a new staff last night in Final Fantasy XI. Actually it’s an Ash Rod. With it I can totally decimate a common wild rabbit with only one strike. Sometimes I like to blind them first though and then hit them. I know it’s not necessary but that’s the sort of person I am.

214,2003-11-17,A Gentleman's Game,"
Links 2004 is much, much better than I expected - and I expected it to drift lightly into my apartment, placed in the CD tray by a glowing angel.  Really, the only things we would add are:


a)  The ability to talk only to your teammate.  This is mostly for Gabe, who knows more about this sport than I know about anything.  Even though it's Golf, not UC or Wolf or something, if you can play it as a team you need the ability to talk to your teammate.  It doesn't make any difference why.  


b)  They really do need to add a ""Scramble"" gametype.  Without investing too much time in it, ""Scramble"" is essentially Golf co-op.  You both hit, find out who had the best shot, then you both hit from there, and so on.  It has a mode already called ""Best Ball,"" where you take the best score for your team, and also an ""Alt"" gametype, where you take turns hitting - so it's not that they lack for variety, it would just be a great addition to an already ridiculously complete experience.         


A friend and I took down the last seven hours of Prince of Persia in a sitting, completing the game at five o'clock in the morn' and unlocking the original game.  The Sands of Time, like a Snickers bar, is comprised entirely of good things, densely packed - a coalition of complimentary flavors.  If there is a God in heaven who observes and occasionally adjusts the course of human events, they are already working on a sequel up there.  My satisfaction with the game is without blemish, it is absolutely complete.       


Masters Of Doom is a great book, if you haven't read it - at only three hundred pages, you could finish it in a day if you really wanted to.  It includes details that many of us know already or could obtain from other sources, but it compresses a great deal of gaming history - like the first consumer-level 3D accelerators, John Carmack's .plan files, and early floppy-disk subscription services - into a single physical object, which is very convenient.  The book also served to humanize people like John Romero, who by some combination of personal desire and media focus became id's avatar.  He certainly wasn't the first ""name"" to be created by gaming, Sierra On-Line put designers like Jane Jensen, Al Lowe, and Roberta Williams right on the cover for everybody to see - but he actively gripped the mechanism of fame and appeared to enjoy its velocity.  Nice work, if you can get it.     


The dissolution of something like Ion Storm is distressing to any idealist, proof somehow of dire truths that creative people constantly work to suspend or rescind.  It was also predictable.  The book covers - with a level of veracity I can't verify - an earlier period in gaming history, where the right mixture of people under the right conditions became id Software and then the thing virtually disintegrated.  As I said, I don't know how accurate the narrative is from the perspective of John Carmack and John Romero, but I found the dissolution of their creative relationship heartbreaking.  It's certainly not without precedent.  Is that some inviolable law?  How many years do you get to work with a friend before you hate each other?

215,2003-11-18,More on MSG,"Here is a quote from Matt Smith, the Microsoft Game Studio developer responsible for the ball physics in Links 2004. This is from the Xbox forums:



No, the team didn't get whacked, but yes, some people who worked on 2004 were let go. 


It wasn't a product based decision. It was a studio-wide business decision. 


Overall, the Links team lost very few people, although everyone on the team had a big hand in getting this project out the door and those people are going to be difficult to replace. 


For those of you who have followed Links for a long time, I think it would be interesting to know that a large number of people who worked on Links 2004 worked on Links under Access Software. I firmly believe that's part of the reason the game is as good as it is. 


Some of you may also know the Game Designer from way back in the day: Mark McArthur. He has been with Access Software/Links since the dawn of time it seems. He was given the huge task of re-inventing Links on the XBox, and I really believe he did a fantastic job. 


Anyway, just thought I'd let you know that the future of Links is still alive and kicking. The core of the team is still here and we're all excited about the way 2004 turned out and are eagerly looking forward to the next version of Links. 


Null (aka Matt Smith)



Here is a follow up quote from Daryl Welsh, group program manager on all three games I mentioned above:



To follow-up on Matt's (Null's) response and to correct the misinformation from penny-arcade, we did not let half the studio go. There were other internal projects that were cancelled during the year that did not lose the people assigned right away. We kept them on board to help supplement the folks already working on Amped, Links and Top Spin. 


We have great people on our projects going forward. People that are passionate about delivering much further on these great games then we did this time around. 


Our studio in Salt Lake does not do the Football game (it is done in Redmond), so I can't speak to the issue of people there.



You always hear something different from the people who have jobs and the people who don’t have jobs anymore. I certainly did not mean to imply that the future of these franchises was in jeopardy. In fact I was told that these three titles will be the focus of the studio going forward. Since they are concentrating on just a few titles they didn’t need as many people. The fact of the matter is those people that got let go still need jobs and my post was intended to help them out. 


On a side note, I think this is the first time anyone has ever used the word “misinformation” when talking about something we posted here. I find it very exciting to think that I am spreading misinformation. I may move up to half-truths next and then eventually onto wild speculation.

The Avatar had a link to a Register article we found highly amusing, something about being awarded a patent for the circumvention of spam filters.  Now, I believe with unwavering certainty that there is a  reasonable and perhaps even noble reason for wanting to mail people who don't want to be mailed.  I would never disparage corporations, which I think of as fountains of goodwill.  For example, I have full faith that AT&T's new rapedroid - with a bank of three hideous, whirling cocks - is...  Well, it's hard to imagine a proper purpose for such a thing. 

 
A small bit of Final Fantasy news that might invigorate the enthusiasts - after Square Enix released that teaser poster a short while back, clearly showing a surly Bangaa in the lower left, many humans were left curious as to what that exactly it meant.  Check out The Magicbox for the answer - the entire next game takes place in the world of Final Fantasy Tactics, called Ivalice.  It would be very interesting indeed to see in what other ways the two games are related if at all, but with the release of Final Fantasy X-2 this month - as well as the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children - revisiting established worlds is something we can expect more of.  Also, speaking of Final Fantasy X-2, when people were importing it I was reading previews that were predominantly negative.  Now that the US release is upon us, and people understand the language the game is in, wouldn't you know that their little ears just perk up!  Gaming media is adorable, like a yarn basket full of kittens. 


Sort of off topic for the site, but I saw a band called The Polyphonic Spree on Monday that I think people might enjoy.  It is essentially cotton candy you can listen to - sample lyric, ""Hey, it's the sun!  And it makes me shine!""  It goes on like that for about five-and-a-half minutes, but honestly you don't mind because you are starting to feel like everything is going to be alright.  The band is more than twenty people, I don't know how many exactly, but a lot.  Grab a song like the one I mentioned, entitled It's The Sun, or my personal favorite Soldier Girl - it's on iTunes if you're trying that out, it's on Buymusic.com, and you may be quite sure it is on your filesharing service of choice.  I don't know if I would sit and listen to a whole album straight through, but as a playlist additive it comes highly recommended.  The album, recorded in three days, is a perfectly satisfactory production but I listen to it mainly to remember what they were like live - aurally enormous.  We were lucky enough to have a Sign Language interpreter at our show - I don't know if you've ever seen someone speak it, it looks like karate, like someone could get hurt.  


Have we really been doing Penny Arcade for Five Years?  I guess there's no way to argue against it, the date is right there in the archive.  It snuck up on us before we could even plan some kind of festive event to accompany it.  It is difficult not to descend, as I so often do when trying to express gratitude, into that Hallmark realm of platitudes and couplets.  I appreciate very much your taking the time to visit the site.  Gabe asked me what I thought was on the menu for year six, and that's easy enough to discuss without humiliating myself or saying something that rhymes.  People are always asking us how they can get jobs in the Industry, except we don't know how, we just sort of made ours up - so we're going to fix that.  We'll have a searchable job finding thingy in the very near future.

Penny Arcade's other purpose is to measure time for us, like a metronome - commemorating the site's fifth year will serve any person on a romp through the archive as well.  I'm sorry to keep harping on it, but it just seems so impossible.        


I think I've reached some sort of equilibrium, game-wise, but any retail release could threaten it:


Project Gotham Racing 2 is something I can just get into and get out of.  The game certainly has multiplayer racing modes, but I haven't even gotten there yet - I can get last place at home, and nobody sees it.  The thing about it is that even when you're just racing solo, everything you do is correlated to some larger purpose online.  Every time I finish a track, it's uploading my score to the server, and at any point while I'm racing I can get an invite to this or any other game.  If I want to see how the best driver in the world does a track, I can just grab his ghost from the server and see that he drafts the other car about seventy percent of the time.         


Links 2004 gets played at night, with a rotating firmament of golf stars - Kitsucoon, Geshtu, Tepid, Vandelay, Longman, and Sir Greybeard.  If you want to get in a round, we're up playing the great team-based modes at 10pm or so PST.  We'd love to have you, and you're probably suffering just like we are - waiting at that join screen for someone to pop in.  I'll set up a tournament once I finish my post, hopefully that will bring a few of you out as well.     


I'm also playing Uru whenever I can.  I'll wait for a couple more patches before I invest myself too heavily in the multiplayer portion, which as I've said before has promise but in practice makes absolutely no sense.  I have heard it described as a multiplayer chatroom, and that is certainly part of the experience, but the main draw of the online element is the stream of new puzzle ages as well as alterations to old ones.  I renewed my focus on the single player mode and held off the multi when I entered a world of absolute lavender.  No nothing, no weird switches or mushrooms or dark murmurs, just purple, deep and wide.  I have a very high opinion of their artistry, and I am willing to trust them a great deal, but I'm fairly certain that was a bug.          


The game I'm playing virtually any other time, like when a level in Uru loads let's say, which takes like a fucking day, is Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.  This space might originally have seen a sort of verbal funeral for Nintendo, a benediction, recounting the good times but bearing a stern appraisal.  I'm starting to wonder if the Cube just isn't where it's at for them, if they don't just like their little clamshell better.  I know I do.  The only time my Cube gets any use is when I'm using my Game Boy Player or when I need to set down my drink.


Mario & Luigi, though - look at those reviews, the entire world is united in song.  Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario showed just how well the conventions of these erstwhile plumbers mesh with a role-playing cosmology, and their showing on the GBA is simply...  I think ""pure"" is the word I would use.  It is actually very exciting to, in the trappings of an RPG, bop a goomba.  The attacks have timing elements, and defending yourself also has a sort of arcade, reaction-time element, and since you control both Mario and Luigi simultaneously these battles can manifest some fairly tricky platform elements.  I take it with me everywhere.      


I'd never even heard of ""Fry's"" until that MC Frontalot track, but apparently they have one dangerously close to me now so I'm going to see what the big deal is.  I say dangerously because they are apparently magic cities, like Oz, stocked high with wonders.

219,2003-11-24,Star Wars rant!,"
I just got an interesting email from PA reader Wes who had the opportunity to attend a book signing by James Luceno author of The Unifying Force. He had this to say:



“I was lucky enough to attend James Luceno's book signing tour when Unifying Force was released, and before the actual signing session, there was a short period of Q&A with the author. Someone asked him about comic book tie-ins with the NJO which reminded me of a much more important question! So I asked him if during any of the planning meetings, had there had been any discussion over the possibility of NJO based video games? His response was that there had been a small amount of discussion concerning video games, but that the overall opinion of LucasArts was that the percentage of Star Wars fans who read the Expanded Universe novels AND played the video games was too small, so they didn't want to release a game solely taking place in the EU and risk driving the more casual fans away. So... sad news for us who have been hoping for the opportunity to pilot Chiss Clawcraft against Coralskippers.”


I know that gamers are reading the NJO series. I’ll agree that there probably isn’t enough of a fan base to make any game set in the EU an instant hit. What I don’t understand though is why LucasArts thinks casual fans of Star Wars would be driven off by a game set in the NJO time period. 


You want to know the reason I never talked about Rebel Strike? Because I only played the first couple of levels before I was sick of it. I love Star Wars but Jesus Christopher Christ, there are other stories to tell. I have shot down all the tie fighters I want to shoot down. I don’t want to shoot down another one. I don’t care if it’s a tie interceptor, I’m done. Why not take this opportunity to introduce the casual Star Wars fans as you call them to the wonders of the EU? Maybe ease them into it with a few games set in during the X-Wing series of books. The final battles with the empire and the liberation of Coruscant would make for an awesome game. Tactical/stealth is all the rage now so how about a game dealing with the top secret missions of Wraith Squadron? 


Then once you have them up to date regarding the current state of affairs in the SW universe you spring the Vong on them. Some FPS games with characters pulled from the New Jedi knights like the Solo twins or Corran Horn. Hell you can even keep them in the Rogue Squadron series only now the squad is under Gavin Darklighters command and they’re shooting down Skips instead of ties. Did you ever think that exposing more Star Wars fans to these characters might in turn help sales of the books and comics? I mean once a game comes out with X-Wings fighting giant organic ships made of living coral people are gonna want to know the fucking back story. 


Just Look at KOTOR for God’s sake. That’s the best fucking Star Wars game you ever published and there isn’t a single X-Wing in it. If you were worried about driving away causal fans that’s the game that would have done it. But instead it turned out to be a huge seller and one of the best games on the Xbox. People want something new! The EU is there, just fucking give it to them.


I’m so fucking mad right now I can’t even see.

I have had the opportunity on multiple occasions to meet hundreds of you at conventions all over the country. We are just regular people who happen to love video games. 


With that in mind we have put together a little something we like to call “Child’s Play”. Penny Arcade is working with the Seattle Children’s Hospital and Amazon.com to make this Christmas really special for a lot of very sick kids. With the help of the Children’s Hospital we have created an Amazon Wish List for the kids. It’s full of video games, movies and toys. Some of these kids are in pretty bad shape and just having a Game Boy would really raise their spirits. 


Please take some time to browse the Wish List. Maybe all you can afford is a package of batteries or maybe you want to go in with your entire office and get the kids a GameCube. Every single contribution will help out the Children’s Hospital and the 190,000 kids they treat each year. 


All the toys and games will be delivered to us and we will in turn deliver them to the Children’s Hospital. As soon as the toys start arriving I’ll set up a web site and post as many pictures as I can. We will be making a trip over to one of the hospitals next week and we’ll bring you back stories from some of the kids along with more pictures. 


Penny Arcade has a readership of something like 150,000 gamers across the world. We are arguably the largest community of gamers on the internet. The important word there being community. This isn’t IGN, this isn’t Gamespy, we are not a faceless corporation, you are not just a number tracked by a database and then relayed to hungry advertisers. You guys have proven yourselves to be a powerful force when stirred into action. Here is your opportunity to use that power to do some real good. 


Let’s give these kids the Christmas that they deserve and let’s give the news papers a different kind of story to write about gamers.

***UPDATE***


A few of you have asked some good questions so I wanted to make an update.


-The hospital has asked that the items not be wrapped. It just generates a lot of waste that costs money to get rid of. 


-Don’t worry about this news post slipping off the front page tomorrow. This is probably the most important thing we’ve ever done and we plan on keeping it on the front page through Christmas. 


-We will be adjusting the numbers on many of the items and as things get purchased we will be adding more. 


-Some of you have asked if you can simply donate money towards the purchase of toys for the kids. Since we no longer have a Club PA Tycho and I have decided to use that PayPal account for Child’s Play. If you would like to make a donation you can now do so right here.


-If you would rather purchase the games or toys someplace else you are welcome to do so. Simply send them to the address listed below.


ATTN: Brad Walker

18303 Bothell Everett Hwy

Suite 140

Mill Creek, Wa 98012


-We cannot actually accept used games or toys for this particular event. However, we appreciate so many of you offering your used systems and whatnot. We’d ask that you please hang onto those for right now. This is just the first tiny baby step for Child’s Play. We may very well be calling on you again in the future and at that point used games might be just what we need.


-Please be mindful of the shipping dates when you’re purchasing items from the wishlist in order to make sure that they get to the kids on time.  We’d like to receive everything by December 20th.


-Some people have mentioned that when trying to purchase an item from the wish list, Amazon occasionally loses the shipping address and defaults to your own address.  If this happens, please just use the address posted above.

I would imagine that the great preponderance of you are, just now, awaking from a indistinct vision of roasted birds and heritage desserts.  Was it real?  And what should you see on Penny Arcade but a comic that references female genitalia with an almost harrowing specificity.  I doubt this will be a template for future strips, unless in our wisdom we can find a way to make these organs evoke Deus Ex.  


You've certainly seen the evidence of it here in the post, I'm spending a lot more time with consoles these days than I ever really expected to.    It turns out I'm married, or at least, there's a woman here that won't leave, and there are starting to be frequent physical conflicts as regards this strange person and the use of the television.  I don't deny the allure of this device in its natural state, unaided by gaming hardware - it illuminates lives with its intellectual diversions.  For example, there is a program on there where five homosexuals ridicule a man for not being gay.  There is another program where a group of strangers descend upon your home and force you to throw away your prized possessions.  There's a visceral thrill in watching people you don't know debased, and I caw like a crow pecking a dead pet on the median line.


However, these border clashes as regards the TV have become more frequent since the introduction of Links 2004, which has inexplicably risen to a golden throne which rules all games that I play.  There is no excuse or explanation I could proffer to explain why I, reasonably hardcore in my tastes, have focused in on a game that is clearly based on Golf.  I decided that it was time to purchase a television of my own, and you cannot know how excited Gabriel was at this turn of events.  You see, the realm of televisions, indeed, the whole sphere of the audio visual is succulent to him, like a berry.  I even went so far as to get a Best Buy card, an act highly outside my character, because I feel the effects of ""credit"" physically as surely as I would feel the grip of a giant ape.  Thought I think it might break Gabe's heart, I've decided not to buy one after all.  All I want is another display, preferably one that is capable of the dizzying resolutions cats prefer.     


Before I'd given myself over to this ""TV Buying"" concept that so enraptured my cohort, I had briefly investigated the X2VGA box as a way of getting the job done.  I went ahead and ordered it yesterday, and I should have some idea if it is an acceptable solution within about a week and a half.  I'd read this review, they seemed to like it fine, and I know my man Steve at HardOCP vouched for it - the only thing that held me off was that I'd need a VGA switchbox and another wire to get it all done, and it introduced a slight distortion into my purchasing algorithm.  Well, they're giving a VGA switcher and an audio converter away now for the cost of shipping, which completely negated my hesitation.  Like all technology enthusiasts, I bend toward optimization like a flower to the sun.  I have incrementally approached my goal of complete immobility for years, and it looks like I may finally be nearing that Narnian locale.


Our Child's Play Wishlist makes me feel like a real man, like a gladiator.  Obviously, you can get the same feeling, and you know how to get it.  But I keep wanting to describe the way I feel about it in these hyper-masculine terms, like ""We're going to kick the Children's Hospital's Ass...  With Toys"" or something like that.  I can say without any hyperbole that the Children's Hospital will have never seen anything like what we will be bringing them.  Those hippos won't be hungry for very long, if you get my meaning.

We sort of have charity on the brain at the moment.  Our best estimates - between toys people have purchased and money that has been donated - come to about thirty thousand dollars.  I didn't use italics on those words, which pains me, but I want them to stand on their own.  Thirty thousand dollars.  Take a look at just what the first two days of orders look like, and you will know joy.  People are taking this as partly a way to communicate our traditions to a new generation, judging from the amount of Namco Classics, Zelda Gamecube bundles, and Links To The Past they have there.  We've got orders from Germany, Ireland, London, yes I know that's not a country, Australia, New Zealand...  What you people are doing hardly seems possible, I think I had convinced myself that the world was a bad place where worse things happen.  We need to figure out where to focus this beam next year, and soon.          


The new Napster makes me feel so conflicted.  


On the one hand, hey, it's Napster!  Remember him?  He was our friend who went away!  On the other hand, he's not really back.  He's returned from some kind of lobotomy, with a row of ugly red stitches on his forehead like tracks to the ultimate nothing.  What was once the scene of a great battle, a sort of consumer Alamo, is now a cute little shop which sells trinkets meant to evoke that conflict.  Conceptually, it's problematic.  You can fish some cool metaphors out of it, though. 

Napster the free service is now Napster 2.0, the buy things service.  In some ways it's an analogue of the iTunes service, complete with complimentary audio player.  In other ways, it's insane.  Let me tell you how. 


So, you're welcome to peruse their catalogue of music and purchase songs for ninety-nine cents a pop, which it seems is about the price they're going to charge a person to download a song.  There is a crazy thing they do with their ""premium memberships"" I'll get into in a moment, but I would say that the main thing that it different about their service is that, subjectively now, they appear to have a lot of Goddamn music.  They have things I am looking for more often than they don't.  I've used BuyMusic, iTunes, and Napster, and they all have content holes I need the other services to surmount.  I just need to go off the farm less with the Napster client up.     


Here's the weird thing I mentioned:  so yes, if you want to burn tracks, you have to buy them.  Ditto for copying to a portable device of some kind.  You have unlimited burning of files, like iTunes, and unlike BuyMusic, but anybody with their head on straight just buys the tracks, burns them, and and rips them to MP3 so that burning proscription is about as resilient as paper mache.  Let's say you just want to listen to music, from any PC, and burning stuff isn't really your cuppa.  For ten dollars a month, you can play the full version of virtually any song in their library.  That's a lot of songs.  You'll run into some trouble with certain artists, or should I say their publishers - some tracks are ""buy only,"" so they can't be used this way.  For example, any Depeche Mode song?  Available.  Blind Melon?  On three albums, all but three songs are playable.  I thought they might reserve the best songs on an album or something, but that's not borne out by most of the ones I've looked at.  It's some rights thing, and I would imagine that as time passes they will get more complete coverage.        


Today is the last day of my free trial, and I'm trying to figure out if ten dollars a month is a good amount given the limitations on where I could listen to it.  I really need to be serious with myself about how often I leave this chair.  Once, twice a week?

The first two pages of our Rainbow Six comic are now live. My friends who have seen all the pages keep telling me this is the best stuff I’ve ever done. I know I’ve certainly pushed myself really hard on this project and come up with some stuff that I’m really proud of. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Tycho is really nailing the story and the dialogue. When he delivers a script as good as the one he’s making for R6 I sort of feel like the son of a bitch is trying to steal my thunder. So then I work even harder to make the visuals really kick ass.

Season's Greetings from Penny Arcade!


Seattle has a reputation for being rainy and dismal that is often exaggerated.  Why, just two years ago I saw the sun, and I recalled - as though it were a piece of obscure, bonus round trivia - that our world orbits a star.  So often going outside as an alternative to staying in is only realistic if you love being damp and actively want to seek out that state.  It is often the case that as a form of entertainment I will wait for something that is supposed to arrive.  Sometimes short-term (pizza), sometimes long-term (alien masters, mandroids) - but imagining how some new force will alter my life is by now a treasured activity.


Brenna and I will often watch programs on your ""TLC,"" and it has warped us beyond repair.  I have installed a row of shelves, for Christ's sake.  Brenna made curtains for a profound alteration to the computer room, which now includes a desk for the computer I built her day before yesterday.  She does not ordinarily trust any machine more complex than a sewing machine, but she decided it was time to admit what century we live in.  I don't know that it will get much use, which is depressing, but what do you do.  It is as though I had a keen interest in the poisonous snakes of the Amazon, and then got her one because I liked them so much.  She has already chosen a Boromir wallpaper for the device, which presents an interesting quandary.  Though she has selected a hot guy as her desktop, he is from The Lord Of The Rings.  It's like some kind of geek loophole that I'm powerless to negate.           


I'd also brought the Xbox in here, though there's no television to play it on, because I've been waiting for that X2VGA that I mentioned.  Every day, some portion is spent picturing myself running through a field with the adapter, pushing the buttons on top of it and otherwise getting to know each other.  Here is a picture of it, if you would like to see it - it arrived the day I built that Shuttle for Brenna.  It does everything they said it would.


The basic idea, as I mentioned before, is that it turns a monitor into a display for an Xbox.  There were devices like this available for the DC, if you'll recall - but I never availed myself of one because I never needed it that bad.  Aside from it simply being a matter of convenience, the Xbox is capable of resolutions mortal televisions cannot produce - the saucy 480p, the coy 720p, and the molten 1080i.  So, in some ways, a monitor is superior to a television.  In other ways, it isn't - but that's through no failing of the device.  The fact of the matter is that the signal displayed is much crisper than you would see on a television, and so the slight blurring of a television display - sometimes called ""the poor man's anti-aliasing"" - actually improves the apparent visual quality of the image.        


I found this somewhat distracting at first, because I'd already seen what these games look like.  With new games, especially ones that support the more advanced 720p and 1080i modes, I don't think it will be so disconcerting.  And now, after a few nights of play, It's not really something I notice anymore.  The ability to move directly from browsing the web or Call of Duty and right over into Links or Rainbow Six 3 far outweighs any qualms I might have otherwise mulled over.  It isn't that the games look bad, they look great.  But for a PC gamer who is used to playing his games on this monitor at 1280, thirty-two bit, it's just a rough transition.  


There are very few games that the X2VGA doesn't support, not due to some hardware failing but because the games in question actually don't support progressive scan modes.  You can see a list here that will tell you - any game that doesn't support 480p won't really be playable.  The trouble is, the Xbox displays the Dashboard - its user interface - in 480i, 480p's evil twin.  It also displays DVDs in 480i.  The X2VGA has a mode called ""480i EasyView"" which allows you to see your Dashboard and make any changes that need changing, but the effect is very strange and blurry and wouldn't be acceptable for any sustained purpose.  That's my only disappointment when using the X2VGA, and that isn't even their fault.  At any rate, it allows me to play Xbox games on my monitor with no visual artifacts or lack of precision.  They have made fantastic device that probably saved my marriage.    


A quick side-note:  You can now, for the price of shipping, elect to get a VGA switchbox that will let you select your computer or your Xbox just by pressing a button.  In my experience, I get a lot of ghosting on my PC desktop when I use the one they provide.  It might be these cables I'm using to hook it up, I'm still experimenting with it - if I figure out what it is specifically, I'll let you know.  I'm simply saying that while I vouch for the X2VGA device itself, I'm not overwhelmed by the pack-in switchbox. 


When the news crew came out to talk about Child's Play, I was as frightened of the camera as I would have been by a loaded weapon or perhaps a large scorpion.  So it's really my fault that they got the impression that Brad and Gabe run Penny Arcade, and that I in fact do not exist.  It's just not important to me right now.  If that report - which proved my every dark, deeply held conviction about local news - if that report puts this project in front of people then let's call it good.  To say that we're at ninety thousand dollars on this toy drive would not be an overstatement.  It would be factual.

230,2003-12-10,The Wonderful World of Words," 
You have probably heard about killography, the new word coined by the National Institute on Media and the Family to describe our depraved entertainments.  Yes, Spell Checker, that is now a word.  We do not dispute that it is a lot of fun - perhaps even stuponfucious - to invent new words to describe the events in our world.  We also think there are perfectly acceptable words that exist already, whole books full of words, some of which are capable of describing gratuitous violence.  The trouble is, they just don't pack the propaganda punch cultural watchdogs crave.


I've seen articles recently praising the ESRB ratings system, which is great, and while I endorse efforts to make people aware of that system I don't think it's all that hot.  It's the system we've got, so I don't mind using it until we change it to the system I am about to describe.   


There is absolutely no reason that games should not be utilizing the same ratings system as movies.  


The shift isn't really that complex.  The ESRB has EC (Early Childhood), E (Everyone), T (Teen), M (Mature), and AO (Adults Only).  I've never seen the first one or the last one.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they have established this parallel system in order to actively exploit the fact that parents don't know what it means, but that's impolite and I apologize.  At any rate, let's just switch it out.  G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17 are perfectly analogous to the existing system, the only difference being parents already know what it means.  No doubt, parents will continue to let schools, televisions, and videogames do their parenting.  The only difference is now they can't feign ignorance regarding the content.       


The movie industry, which boosters of electronic entertainment always compare our passtime to, polices itself because they know that PG-13 is a magical alchemical formula for producing money.  Certain sorts of movies, or movies released at certain times strive for this rating because it is a sort of sweet spot.  It's possible that a system that employed the sensible, established ratings for films might have a similar effect - coupled with enforcement of these ratings at the store level.  Ordinarily, I support measures like this with tongue firmly in cheek, because I know that young gamers are clever creatures:  they can get their games on ISOs from IRC, so my suggesting such a system won't actually keep you from games any more than some RIAA bugaboo is going to keep you from downloading music.  But I have a fear that this whole thing - the whole violent games thing - is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.  Call it a hunch.    


In a bit of Child's Play news, I'm completely exhausted.  We outgrew the second of two storage areas, so we had to rent a truck and unload all the toys to a third storage facility.  This one is pretty vast - it's also more secure - so it seems like it'll probably keep us for the long haul.  I'd love to give you an update on the amount we're up to, but I couldn't even hazard a guess at this point.  Not even counting toys, there's twenty-thousand in Paypal - we're going to see if we can go to Kinkos and get one of those big Publisher's Clearing House checks made.  Also, MG over at Slackers ran a drive on his site to buy an Xbox for Child's Play - and they did it!  A webcomic in Singapore raises money for sick children in Seattle, a gamer's charity drive raises over a hundred thousand dollars in toys and donations - and then some dumb fucker pulls a firearm at a Counter-Strike tournament.  This is a communique to all dumb fuckers - we're trying to do something here, idiots.  Do you think you could maybe not kill anybody for the next, oh, twelve days?  I know it's hard.

231,2003-12-12,As Foretold In Revelations," 
Two things:  


One, He is risen!  We had originally considered doing a completely reverent comic about the Nativity.  I don't know what else to tell you, yesterday was pretty weird all around.


Two, Double Dash is the business.  I don't really have anything amazing to say about the single-player mode, a fairly humdrum plow, endured to reveal new karts and characters only.  Some reviews have checked in with lower but still respectable scores, which excoriate the game for ""being the same as the old version"" and ""changing things"" simultaneously.  I do not envy the man who must, shaman-esque, interpret the signs and wonders of some new sequel - particularly when it's a sequel to a franchise so buoyed by the affection of gamers.  Yes, it's true - one may no longer ""hop"" around corners or over some obstacle.  It has been replaced by a powerslide mechanic that is far looser than you you would find in a pure racing game - even in the middle of a slide, you have a fair amount of control over your movement and facing.  More importantly: when played co-operatively, the person riding on the back of the cart handles the boosting of any powerslide with a quick input, producing the blue sparks that can confer a quick burst of speed at the end of every slide.  At this point, we can get blue sparks at virtually any time, even on the Blue Sparks Challenge - or (BSC) - which we ourselves invented. 


So, while hopping is (of course) very traditional I do not have any issue with powersliding per se, and might even prefer it - because of its co-operative nature.  It's not like the guy on back is just throwing shells or some shit as I had originally surmised.  He's certainly managing your team as an offensive force, but he's also punching other carts to steal their stuff, not to mention producing the critical blue sparks.  The driver can carry another powerup as well, which you can sort of salt away until you toss it back to your teammate.  Each person will be busy the entire time, I can assure you.  I found solo, one player to a kart racing to be plenty of fun on its own in the various game modes, but I won't deny that I've already had that particular kind of fun.  Playing only that gametype, one may feel as though their beloved franchise has either stagnated or been diluted or whatever other sad-sack bullshit.  Playing two people to a kart, however, is not some trivial, superficial addition you can simply eschew, like mayonnaise.  It's not some irrelevant condiment.  I would argue that it's the entire Goddamn point.       


Outside of Double Dash, it's the new Myst game that has been absorbing any time not seized by Child's Play.  It's usually system-intensive games like an FPS that instigate a round of hardware upgrades, but the fact that my SATA RAID was largely inspired by the load times in Uru either makes me really hardcore or a complete nut job.  I saw the original Myst for the first time in Journalism class, on one of the machines we used to do layout.  The teacher, Ted Ketcham, understood that we were looking at something completely amazing, and let us play it the entire period instead of writing hate-filled screeds about the ASB.  It's an index of technological evolution that we've gone from that - pre-rendered, streaming off the CD-ROM - to beautiful, real-time worlds of comparable granularity in less than ten years.  I bear witness to stunning vistas every time I load that fucker, this isn't some Quake 3 shit with maybe a curved arch.  Like all puzzle games, Uru certainly has it's share of frustrations.  At this point, three ages in, I have found the trade-off acceptable, and the rewards - aurally and visually - highly significant.    


As a sidenote, it was that same journalism teacher that discouraged my use of italics, submitting humbly that the writing itself should be clear.  Using italics now is only part irresponsible writing, and part homage. 


The statistic is two days old, but Child's Play is now at a hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars in toy and cash donations.  The original storage place now acts as a staging area, and is as full as it was when we needed a truck to take it all out.  You guys are going to kill me.

A long while ago, almost a year to the day in fact, I discussed what a danger I felt The Sims Online could become given geeky predilections for romantic drama.  As it turns out, strange things do happen there - and my original assessment, submitting to you that perhaps a boy and a girl would meet and like each other, turns out to have been on the tame side.  


It's really very important to me that you go to the Alphaville Herald and read the articles it contains.  Consisting largely of player interviews, the pieces available cover such unimaginable topics as the origin of the Shadow Government, demolition of player property, money trading, prostitution, player abuse, and in general conversations with people at the highest levels of simulated power.  Please note that the person who runs the site, Urizenus, was recently banned from the game for putting a link to an external site in his profile and on his in-game property, which apparently constitutes a violation of the Terms Of Service.  For everyone keeping score at home, this means that fraternal crime organizations are okay and that madames running electronic whorehouses, making real money selling sex with newbies, that's okay, but if you post a Goddamn URL it's some kind of war crime.  I honestly don't know what other lesson we are supposed to take from that.  Urizenus actually believes he was banned for his activities on the Alphaville Herald, which is something I can't speak to - I don't doubt that those terms of service are written in such a way that they could eject you for using vowels.  They don't just own the ball, which they can take and go home.  They own the ball, the entire block, the world which contains that block and their logo is emblazoned upon the constituent atoms.  They are the authors of physical law and have a switch - as God does - which can make and unmake the world.       


Just a quick note, but have you checked out Unreal II's ""XMP"" demo - the Expanded Multiplayer?  Originally intended for ship, to get the game out on time they ""focused on the single player experience,"" which was unfortunate because I had a lot of faith in the vague rumors and incomplete game concepts I had heard.  Try the free demo I mentioned before or, if you own Unreal II already, download the real thing which clocks in at three hundred megs.  Tribes fans will, I think, find a lot to like here - expansive outdoor areas, light, medium, and heavy armors, and double-jumps that give men wings.  Aside from looking completely fantastic, I like how it combines CTF style gameplay with resource management, diverse ordinance, and vehicles.


As for Child's Play, things are essentially nuts but we're in the home stretch now.  You can take a look at some of the new pictures I uploaded last night, if you'd like - they deal with getting the truck and also how you can open toys for almost eleven hours and not make a dent.  To give the gifts even a remote chance of Christmas delivery, we'll be taking the Wishlist down later today - if you've been meaning to get in there, that's something you should do immediately.

I'm not sure why, as it is a game where you must literally get a job, and learn not to spend all your money of toys and videogames.  It produces a genuinely profound mental state, with its rows of ironies which hum like subterranean machinery.             


I attended the midnight showing of Return of the King, though I clearly have tickets for today's 4:45 as well.  While Brenna enjoys the Rings films as much (and probably more) than I do, the midnight ritual so critical to my people is wholly alien to her way of thinking.  On the other hand, the way that each of her friends has chosen a different member of the Fellowship to be their favorite so as not to overlap affections is somewhat mysterious to me, as well.  It is as though we're dealing with a sort of Medieval Beatles, where each girl's romantic dreams can only exist in a world unsullied by the cruel mitigations exemplified by the Venn Diagram.  There can be no sharing.  Brenna's a Sam girl, Sarah's down with Frodo as I understand it, and of course Kate pines for Aragorn, son of Arathorn.  He's into elves, I'm not sure how that's going to work out.  At any rate, it would appear that Legolas is available.  There may need to be some kind of Internet registry for fantasy hunks.     


You may be wondering whether or not this is a good movie.  You want to know if the hopes you have invested in it will be dashed, your good heart trampled as it was when you left Episode One - gasping at the naked contempt displayed by George Lucas.    


I predict that you will be knocked clean on your ass, in the absence of mercy, pounded by raw craft and quality for the film's over three hour duration.  I liked Two Towers well enough, preferred Fellowship, you know, but it'll do.  It was better than jabbing your hand into a box of used medical sharps.  Return of the King, by comparison, is every element executed with laser-guided precision.  At one point, I covered my gaping mouth with the Hordes of the Underdark manual.  Yes, I brought it.  I'm sort of a big dork, maybe nobody told you.


I got home about four o' clock in the morning, made a pot of coffee, and started in on the post.  I would not call my thoughts contiguous at this point - it may be time to go to sleep.  One last thing, though. 


There is a new batch of Child's Play pictures, four or so I think, which start at number 46.  It shows the fancy new storage facility a little bit, it's something I could whip up a quick diagram of if people were interested.  We have an extremely (read: not terribly) elaborate system to manage the influx, which required yet another truck and an eleven-hour day on Monday just to manage it.  For a moment I thought we were seeing the beginnings of a lull, but then a hundred more boxes came at once.  We sent Kinko's an image of a check for $27,406.18 that they're going to print out really big on some foamboard.  We'll give the Children's Hospital a real check too, just in case their bank doesn't recognize pretend money.

Anyone wondering whether we're right or not will be silenced forever by the 75th Annual We're Right Awards.  The games that made the most profound impressions on us will be paraded before you, barring a few anomalies like Crystal Chronicles which hasn't had a domestic release.  Without further ado...    



12.  Desert Combat


This isn't the first time you've heard me mention Desert Combat, the Battlefield mod from Trauma Studios that hijacks a retail engine and exceeds the original content in all significant ways.  They aren't even done yet, far from it - a new version just dropped, in fact - but already the refined classes, mobile spawn points, gripping new maps and cutting-edge ordinance make a deep impression. 



11.  WarioWare Inc:  Mega Microgames


The sensation of madness one gets the first few times they play WarioWare does recede, blessedly, leaving in its place a pleasing vibration in your skull.  For those of you unfamiliar with this bizarre experiment, WarioWare is a collection of around two hundred games - each only three seconds or so long - which are played in stages of increasing difficulty.  Once you've made your way though - and let me make clear, a single playthrough might reveal about half the games - you can unlock new versions of old Nintendo games, a few other untimed games, and even a few two player games which are played on a single GBA.  It is in my estimation a bold move to create a game where one Keeps A Kitten Dry or Brushes One's Teeth.  They're great ideas at any rate, things I'd like to encourage.  So, in addition to dispensing a unique cat and tooth based morality, the game is also inventive and highly amusing.  Let's call it Number Eleven.  



10.  Guilty Gear XX (a.k.a. Guilty Gear X2)


Shit only knows where some of these characters come from.  Little Red Riding Hood will fight a Pool Shark, a Sailor of Some Sort will swing a boat anchor at a ninja restauranteur.  But watch as remarkable, best-of-show artwork makes everything fit with everything else, coupled with a fighting system that is as deep as you want it to be, which reveals its complexity with the silent patience of a Gobstopper.  An erudite fighter that devours the button masher and rewards the acolyte.       


Only having twelve slots with which to enunciate an entire year of releases hurts us within.  Games like Beyond Good and Evil,  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Jak II, and Galactic Civilizations weep only a few inches away from this glorious podium.    


With the help of a few local readers, we will be delivering the toys you donated to the Child's Play drive tomorrow morning at a truly ungodly hour.  We may have a few extra pictures for you after the holiday, but you can always satisfy any immediate curiosity you have by heading to the Child's Play site and clicking on one of the many numbers.  We filled a truck and two minivans today, each one to the ceiling, for our last drop at the storage facility - and though we're making the ""official"" delivery tomorrow, please understand that the post office is still so full of presents that we must make special arrangements for their delivery.           


What we are calling Child's Play was just something we decided to do when we were eating lunch one day, and now near the end of it the shock of your gale-force charity has abated and I have a moment to really appreciate what happened.  I am extremely proud to have been a part of it.

With seventy five years of history, the We're Right Awards is the definitive ceremony of its kind.  Let's look in.



9.  Rainbow Six: Raven Shield


The latest in a storied franchise, Raven Shield would be on here even without the gripping adversarial modes - cooperative play alone would garner an accolade of this measure.  As it stands, you get both in the same box - it's an easy game to recommend, versatile, the sort of game that takes over LAN events years out from release.  Great maps with the feel of real areas, a ridiculously large suite of fully customizable weapons, and the ability to put a little Tycho patch on my shoulder means Number Nine.    



8.  Call Of Duty


Single or Multiplayer, Infinity Ward apparently knows how to please - with stirring sound, powerful scenes, and challenging pomegranates.  They've single-handedly given the World War 2 genre a stay of execution, drawing as they did on new perspectives and considerable experience working in its confines.  The clan I play with will sometimes stay at the spawn in Harbor, shooting the water with a pistol just to enjoy the sound of a single bullet plipping through the surface.  The game is full of fine touches, wholly unnecessary flourishes that elevate it.  If you were wondering how to get on our ""best of"" list for a given year, play Call of Duty and take careful notes.    



7.  Links 2004


The multiplayer matches we've had in Links 2004 quite simply compare with any - any - game we've ever played against other human beings.  I'm as shocked as anyone, and in the abstract it's hard to imagine a game like this providing what you would call ""addictive multiplayer.""  A host of intriguing golf scoring systems and methods of play reward different approaches to the game and require varying levels of teamwork - and nowhere, not in any other experience I've had online, have I had to rely so much on my teammate.  When the whole game comes down to only forty or so individual inputs - for some game types, even less - they matter.  There have been other golf games, other good ones even.  I never got into them like I did Links 2004, which - despite some flaws in presentation - produces the most compelling round of golf out there, multi or no.   


I'm sad that Panzer Dragoon Orta didn't make its way on this list, you'd think since I helped write the list it would be something I had the power to resolve - but this club is so exclusive, it only allows twelve members.  If you'd like to see PDO get its propers, feel free to head over to Gamespot's time-release awards ceremony where it snagged Best Shooter from games like Call Of Duty and Max Payne.  I would never have put those games on the same list - a rail shooter, a third person action game, and an FPS - but anomalies are bound to crop up when you choose genre as your top level hierarchy.  We have absolutely no grouping mechanism whatsoever, I'm not saying their process is faulty.  What we're doing is directly comparing Apples to Nuclear Reactors.  Which one is more crisp, which one produces more electricity, etc.

I just don't have the mechanisms to interface with normal people, and every family visit just emphasizes the fact.  I just referred to my mother-in-law as ""The beast spoken of in Revelations.""  This stuff just comes out, and I don't know how to get it back in.  


We now return to the 75th Annual We're Right Awards.



6. Mario Kart: Double Dash


We finally had a chance to play eight players, two to a kart, and there's simply nothing else like it in the entire continuum of our passtime.  A cooperative racing game simple in concept and pure in execution, the game is so intense race after race that it is actually physically exhausting.  Nintendo makes it hard to defend them at times, when their sparkling first-party titles slow to a trickle and they make what seem like backward decisions regarding online play.  I certainly don't want to give Nintendo credit for something they didn't mean to do, but play Mario Kart:  Double Dash with a group of friends, together, and tell me they don't have a point.    



5. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance


Strange as it is, the GameBoy Advance is becoming the go-to system for satisfying tactical combat.  You could amuse yourself practically anywhere with the beloved Advance Wars series, tuck in for something with a little more meat in Tactics Ogre, or wile away the hours with Fire Emblem's balanced weapons and political intrigue.  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance stands above, combining depth and accesibility with a light story and SquareEnix production values for an accomplished tactical game, a remarkable portable experience, and a great sequel.



4. Soul Calibur 2


What's to say, really.  What seems at first glance like a stock retelling of the Dreamcast classic unfolds like some origami creature into strange dimensions, revealing itself as subtle, elegant, and modern.  It ruled our life for months, first at import and then again for domestic, and it is seeing yet another resurgence.  Some games are classics the second you pop them in the tray - Soul Calibur 2 will grace televisions for years to come.    


Now that it's the twenty sixth and all Christmas mysteries have been revealed, it's time to go back to being anti-social.  Perhaps you're stuck at the parents' house, as I am, forced to make due with an ancient Dell possibly unearthed in an archeological dig.  What you need are lean games that will forgive older hardware and wear the rough edges off family misery.    


In this regard, Addicting Games can absorb as much time as you need it to.  Of course, Popcap has ever been our truehearted companion - their recent Rocket Mania (web or download version) can do the job, but the even more recent Zuma is almost perfectly equipped for zero-commitment, time-wasting duty.  Breaking as it does into a market saturated with Mayan-themed puzzle games featuring stone amphibians, perhaps its mixture of Bust-A-Move and Marbles will help it stand out.



Here's the one that might keep you up at night:  Star Chamber.  If you enjoyed games like Galactic Civilizations or Master Of Orion (X), star empire type stuff, I have a feeling you will be reasonably intrigued if not seized abruptly, filled with glistening eggs as Star Chamber clutches you in the dark.  


I read Bruce Geryk's passionate review of Star Chamber late one night, downloaded it immediately and ran gleefully through the tutorial.  The game itself is free, just an eleven meg download - that's not how they get you.  Here's how they get you:  it's a card game.  A collectible one no less, with a game board that represents a star system and and worlds which are useful to varying degrees.  So you can play it online and solo with what amounts to starter decks, or you can hit their Card Store to purchase virtual boosters, boxes, or tickets to enter online tournaments.  Alternately, subscribers can receive a few packs and tournament entries each month for about six bucks.  At any rate, those are not matters you need to grapple with at the moment.  I just wrapped up my first game, and I can tell you that right from the outset it's more than enough to keep your hand on the mouse.

And now, the winners of the We're Right Awards.



3.  Legend Of Zelda:  Wind Waker


Much was said about the game's unorthodox representation of the much beloved Link, and no one would say that it wasn't a startling move.  This might have been important if the game were a series of non-interactive slides, like a family vacation, but as it turns out there was actually a videogame associated with it.  A good one.  How good?  Oh, let's call it Number Three.



2.  Knights of the Old Republic


Kotor did a lot of things, but aside from being a good RPG, with a great story that twists right up to the end - things which we can all appreciate - it reminded me that Star Wars was actually kind of a good thing.  I hadn't realized to what extent my estimation of it had been degraded.  To my mind, giving Star Wars back to us is grounds for beatification.  You like that word?  I learned it in Italy.       



1.  Prince Of Persia


It looks and plays brilliantly.  It has a good story that ends extremely well.  The combat is siphoned directly from adolescent ninja fantasies.  Shit, it's even funny.  How they managed to capture the spirit of classic platformers - not just the original Princes, but the entire play concept - is simply beyond me.  More games should be this good, we should demand it of developers and they should demand it from themselves.          


We had a couple of high-profile defections into 2004, namely Half-Life 2 and Doom 3.  2003, in my opinion, proved the necessity of having a console around - like you would a Spare Tire - strictly for emergencies.


Since I got home, I've done little else but watch this Firefly DVD boxed set.  I never watched the show when it was on television, though I would demand that Gabriel recount each episode for me in exacting detail.  Understand me when I say that I could regale you for hours, hours, regarding minute details of this science fiction western, which is from the Buffy guy.  How they swear in Chinese, which M.G. assures me is a language uniquely capable of withering a person.  How they combine geisha tradition and prostitution into a sort of bizarre respectability.  I've always liked Westerns, and I've had to tolerate the Old West setting to get my fix of frontier living hardasses that shoots them's what looks at 'em.  It's the best television program in recent memory, and there were three episodes that never aired due to series cancellation - the set has those, too.  I must admit that the whole cancellation scenario really indicts the system we've got set up to produce our television shows.  I propose an indistinct alternate system with hazy details that I will never fully define.        


They say that when God closes a door he opens a window, which is nice I guess, but if it's all the same to him maybe he could just leave the fucking door open?  He's omnipotent, and presumably this state allows him to open a door and a window simultaneously.  Or maybe this is some Myst bullshit where when you open one the other closes automatically, in which case he shouldn't get the credit anyhow.  At any rate, the most recent example of this phenomenon is this - we don't get to have the show anymore, but we do get a movie.  What that has to do with God exactly I'm not sure.

Strange post ahead.  Maybe you should just go.


I don't know for a fact that special holiday times are more awkward for geeks in general, but I can say with a high degree of certainty that they are fairly difficult for me and for every person that I know.  Gabriel's panel is perfectly accurate, and mine is an utter fabrication, but Robert (who is also seen here) probably has us beat.  He spends the holiday in Utah with someone else's family, and in addition to making him a big pot of unadorned white rice to eat - for Thanksgiving - they deal with him as though Asians are some organic novelty, wholly without precedent.  I consider myself fairly sheltered, my isolation is nearly absolute and I abhor the touch of man and woman alike.  However, I am aware that people whose families were originally from other countries are sometimes born here.   


Every year, my mother gets me a new self-help thing for Christmas to, I presume, salve my failures as a human being.  Last year, it was a calendar of daily directives from Dr. Phil, who I firmly believe is a mongrel, more beast than man.  What that creature has to tell me about being a good person I could no doubt learn from any mute animal.  This year, my mom has managed to combine both her annual insult to my intelligence and her incessant proselytizing with a book called ""Wild At Heart:  Discovering The Secret of a Man's Soul.""  You might be thinking that I invented that title in an effort to amuse you - but no.  Like AIDS, it is only too real.  The author, John Eldredge, apparently suffered some emasculating experience as a child and now believes that all men resemble himself, i.e., they are dry and damaged husks.  Then, he suggests a new template to replace these irreparable shells, one that sounds uniformly horrible to me.  I would pity him if he had not become so fabulously wealthy selling his man-kits.  It is, no doubt, a simplification - but it's no more a simplification than the things he put in his book:  there's nothing wrong with a man that a Playstation 2 and a copy of Vice City can't cure.    


I suffer through these inane books, calendars, and men's relationship workbooks out of some twisted filial duty, choke them down, and by the time I finish them sure enough I feel miserable about my life and the decisions I've made.  These materials constitute a strange and mercenary branch of psychology and evangelism that cannot be said to have as its aim the resolution of mental or spiritual ills.    


I apologize, sometimes I write my diary here and forget that I run a gaming site.  


Happy New Year, I suppose, and Happy the other holidays.

here comes oblivion

242,2004-01-02,Perhaps Best Unsaid,"
There are some items for which there are no analogues.  Case in point. 


If you keep an eye toward gaming news at all, you've seen the New York Post article I'm about to mention.  We receive at least one mail pertaining to that piece every ten minutes, sometimes (but not always) with an appended request for comment.  I hadn't yet, because I find the whole thing too depressing - the article itself is just sort of strange.  The author commits himself fully to spurious claims, which will then be read by people without the inclination to verify them and a rage surplus.  It's a frequently iterated recipe. 


To begin, I have seen articles of greater erudition float to the top of my Alpha-Bits.  I know that the paper we're talking about has the word New York in the name, but don't let that fool you into thinking we're talking about a legitimate outlet.  It's clearly a tabloid.  I know, I know - New York.  Like The Land Of Oz.      


The money quote is thus:  ""This is 10,000 times worse than the worst thing anybody thinks Michael Jackson ever did to a little boy.""  Let us endeavor to approach greater understanding.  I don't know what the worst thing people think Michael Jackson did is, but I know what he was charged with - seven counts of child molestation and two counts of using intoxicants, drugs or alcohol, in order to get the other yucky thing done.  I can't believe I'm being made to enumerate these charges, to name that beastly procession like some perverse Adam.  But there you have it, this is the reality that these articles have constructed:  Producing - or playing? - a game where you portray a mobster is just as bad as drugging and then subsequently raping ten thousand children simultaneously.      


One hears a lot about media bias, quite a lot indeed, but the accepted formula goes like this:  


the ""Media,"" capital M, an imaginary monolith with a supposedly synchronized perspective, is saying things that I disagree with.  The things that I believe are right, therefore these factual distortions are the result of some lens - a bias which is deeply ingrained, like a vein of rich silver.     


That's all well and good, but let me propose the CFR Hypothesis, where CFR stands for ""complete fucking retards.""  Let's see if you like it.


The first time the news dumbshits came out to talk about Child's Play, though they were clearly told who was responsible for it they excised one of the people behind it.  I consider this a fairly minor issue, but they're still retarded.  When they came to the Children's Hospital itself for the toy delivery, there was no reporter even down there with us.  A cameraman got some footage and then (I believe) ran away.  I thought I heard him say ""Ghosts!"", but that's neither here nor there.  When this footage was aired, I learned something new:  that the toys had been donated by a local catholic school, and were valued at nearly a thousand dollars.  Understand this.  A single bin of GBA SPs was worth four thousand dollars, and we had four such bins.  That's above and beyond the seventy GameCubes the other twenty carts of toys, which at our best estimates come to around $175,000.  Then there was a check for twenty-seven thousand.  Here's where the depression sets in.   


What we - this is a grand We, which includes you - what we did was completely amazing.  It was worth doing purely on account of its own virtues.  But the other part, what we might call the ""Secondary Objective,"" was to promote the idea that we are not fucking murderers.  This is an effort to combat media portrayals.  Here's the trick, the dark revelation, the Empire Strikes Back which produces our moment of darkness:  we need to rely on that selfsame inept machinery to broadcast our new message as well.  They're simply not capable of it.  I understand that there's just no story in people being good to each other, but that doesn't mean it hasn't happened from time to time.

It just seemed like it was about time to bring him back - we've been working on a lot of longer form projects lately, and I guess it sort of bled over.  We still have that Penny Arcade animated series pilot laying around, if Gabe is open to working with this kind of screen real estate maybe I can get him into it.  I also have a script for a story that takes place in a wild west version of the Jewish holy book, the Torah.  


I noticed at EvilAvatar that Underworld - the werewolf vampire hybrid love story movie thing - was hitting stores this week, meaning that White Wolf apparently didn't get what it wanted out of the courts.  Most of the dramatics took place on message boards or in my e-mail, but know now that I was told ""what for"" regarding this strip and post by every fancy lad capable of the English language.  There was even the occasional dark invocation, written in either Latin or some nonsense vampire script.  I honestly don't mind.           


The grim irony (""tak'shas,"" in the tongue of The Kindred) of the whole thing is that, trust me - you don't want to imply that anything you like is connected with Underworld.  You don't want to let stand even the vaguest assertion in that direction.  Because while Underworld is better than Dental Work, it's not better to any significant degree.  Some of the elements are well visualized.  Though the action setpieces are fairly sparse, they have some decent touches.  It's firmly situated in Rental Country.  But as a whole, I don't think it's any better than what happens at any given kitchen table, or park, when players get together for their own games.  I'm perfectly familiar with the transformative power inherent in pen-and-paper, and even (God help me) Live Action.  So when I fuck with you guys about it, it's probably best to take it as fraternal.      


I was shocked to find that Silent Storm's publisher wanted to advertise here, but they're certainly allowed to.  The demo, which I wrote an extemporaneous poem about, is much fancier fare than one usually gets as a proponent of turn-based strategy.

Gabe's computer was powerful fucked up, and with the freak snowfall we had I couldn't get over there - so if you see only pencils and not newfangled hues, that's the reason.  Point is, we play Mario Kart as much as possible.  You might actually know the guy who bailed on me - Zach Stroum, a.k.a. Durandal, who does Shaw Island and American Animetion.  I was, however, able to pull in an alternate - and the ensuing ruckus cemented my belief that we had chosen our number six game in wisdom.         


It's good in ways that you would have to play it to understand, but there are some elements that can be elaborated on.  Earlier versions of the game had more amusing battle modes, that is a point I will readily concede.  The Bomb mode ain't bad, maybe I'll grow into it.  On the other hand, the racing so pristine as to inspire a sonnet.   


When setting it up for LAN play the first time, if you're coming from a PC or maybe an Xbox you might be startled at how primitive the interface is.  You can Start Game, you can Change Options, and you can break the connection.  As mentioned in reviews you might have read, you can't choose your characters or cars.  This mystified us at first.  It seemed like if they could invent a console, make it networkable, and then write a racing game, they were probably smart enough to make a menu inside that game that would let you choose whether or not you were a turtle.  I'm used to options, options, and more options, and the lack of them resounded.   


After you play for a while, you completely forget about it.  When you hit Start Game, you're thrown right into a race with a car weight you might be unfamiliar with and character you might not have chosen yourself.  They're different every time.  It wasn't until these choices were taken out of our hands that I realized how much time gets spent fucking arguing about those choices under ordinary circumstances.  You'd have it here, too, if they let you choose - shit along the lines of ""Chain Chomps are cheap,"" or ""You always take that Bullet Bill Car.""  But there's none of that.  Sometimes you get a lucky draw.  It never lasts from round to round, and you certainly can't be thought any less of for it.  The whining when we used to have Halo parties was unbearable, of the ""You're using the pistol too much, stop using the pistol"" school.  It's the sort of thing that makes you not want to have Halo Parties anymore, an eventuality which quickly coalesced into an outcome.  By accident or by design, removing these decisions lubricates the experience.  


Don't think I'm just coming up with some florid way to praise Nintendo for what is (in actuality) some oversight on their part.  If they needed to be excoriated, I would apply the necessary heat - independent of my deep emotional attachment.  For example, I'm about to stick it to Bioware. 


I obtained Hordes Of The Underdark with the full intention of playing through it on a LAN this weekend, only to find out that you can't actually do that in their multiplayer roleplaying game.  You can hit Bioware's forum here for their reasoning, and you can also hit this other thread for a few workarounds.  Then, you can hit your head on the edge of your desk over and over again.  Eventually, if you strike continually and with diligence, you will reduce your own IQ to a level where this bullshit makes some sense.             


If I'm going to play an RPG all by lonesome, let's be clear:  it's sure as fuck not going to be based on Neverwinter Goddamn Nights.  I don't doubt that Hordes of the Underdark is very, very nice.  Shadows of Undrentide was so good it made me forget the lukewarm presentation and tolerable UI that game delivers, and that's the nicest thing you can say about it.  But I play those games because they're the Goddamn multiplayer version of Dungeons and Dragons, and I'm not the only one who does that so don't waste your time imagining such a specious universe.


I like Bioware, they make really good games in my opinion - but this is just stupid, the fact that players have invented a few ways to fix it doesn't make it okay.  Make it right.               


Also, for the love of God download that new Splinter Cell trailer.  No, it's not the one people keep calling a new trailer when it's just the old one in a new resolution or without the fucking sound.  As usual, AIX has a great torrent going.

who cares what games we choose

Top Spin is pretty great, I don't know if you've played it.  Gabriel tells me that - outside the inevitable domestic arguments - it's also highly amusing online.  Two things about it you need to know, really.


One, the game really takes an unbelievably long time to load a level.  Hyperbole about load times literally began our comic, so I need to distinguish the load times I'm talking about now from load times I might make a joke about.  With Sin, they put a patch out right after our comic that resolved it.  Load times in Top Spin, they'll always be bad, they aren't getting any better.  How bad are they?  From the moment you start to think ""Damn, this is taking a while"" there's still enough time to build an entire car.  Once you're done, take it out for a spin.  You've still got time. 


Two, we went to high school with one of the selectable characters in the game, Jan-Michael Gambill.  This is actually pretty weird.  Sports Star was probably never in the cards for me, you know?  It's not something I ever really wanted to do.  Sports are virtually the polar opposite of my hobby, complete physical awareness compared to the active dismissal of it.  But when you see somebody you used to know beat John Salmon and Herb Encrusted (I just made those up, I don't think they're tennis players.  Also, I'm kind of hungry) you think, well, I was in the same physical place that person was and perhaps it could have been me instead.  This doesn't make sense, I know.  Life isn't some kind of cakewalk where the music stops and then they take the person on square 23 away to be a professional tennis player. 


I don't really have any complaints about how things are going, at least, no legitimate complaints.  I sometimes wish it were feasible to own a manatee.  You make your peace with things like the manatee issue and you move on.  But man, there is something about success in others that just kills a person.

It became clear as we were writing the strip that it could not really capture what we were trying to say regarding Sonic Heroes, and that another method might need to be employed toward that end.  Eventually, we settled on ""language"" as a means of communicating ideas.      


Sonic Heroes hasn't done all that terribly review-wise, thought it would be difficult to say it was doing well.  If it weren't a Sonic game, it could be shitty and stand no chance of piercing my cynicism, which years of game industry abuse has transformed into something like an exoskeleton.  Instead, I'm left with the rather stark impression that Sega has either forgotten what makes good Sonic game, or they don't care.  Well, I do.  If the next Mace Griffin game is a game where you manage a restaurant empire, you know, no big deal.  I think can state with conviction that there are very few who would even notice if the second Mace Griffin game recasts the grizzled space mercenary as a lively restauranteur.  We're talking about Sonic, though, and I'd prefer that to mean something again.    


There is a very interesting review of Sonic Heroes on 1up by Nich Maragos, and in it he presents the following ""outside the box"" concept:  that Sonic-style gameplay is boring, and that Sonic Heroes is the worse for including it.  That is funny to me, because the only time this game gets it right is when it casts off all the extraneous bullshit they keep adding - when it focuses on the things that made Sonic Mario's tireless nemesis.  


Nich's reasoning goes like this:  Sonic Team, for better or worse, keeps making games that have these large cats or robots and what have you, characters of divergent ability, and these other types activities never mesh properly with the straight-ahead, balls out Sonic speed the games seem to be oriented around.  He and I are in complete agreement on this point - the game is a failure - but our solutions differ.  He's resigned to it, he says as much - but since they clearly persist in making games of this type, they need to tone down the Sonic and let these other characters take a more central role if they want a game that feels at all unified in purpose.  I propose precisely the opposite - jettison the rest of this bolted-on garbage and focus absolutely on the speed, rings, and quirky bonus worlds that define the classic games.  


I'd grant that he's more likely to get his wish, because as I said before they forgot or don't care why Sonic was great.  So if they make new Sonic games that go even further in this new direction, keep in mind that they would not be, strictly speaking, Sonic games at all, Sega might as well do what he's talking about because I won't be playing the fucking things anyway.  The shame of it is that at the very beginning, Sonic Heroes implies a possible direction for the series that we hoped the entire game would embody - a game that, were you to turn the perspective to the side, would look very much like a 2d platformer.


They quickly get away from that, and indulge themselves in the same sorts of unappealing goofy camera, indoor bullshit that they apparently crave overseas - making a mockery of the classic Casino zones in the process.  They've never been able to make that Goddamn camera work right, they seem to delight in misery of this sort, and I wonder why they don't let the game itself tell them what they're doing wrong.  Lock the camera behind Sonic, or in front (as they did in clever sequences from Sonic Adventure), or to the side in the classic style.  I'm ready for a return to a two-dimensional gameplay - used judiciously, when called for by specific zones and used in conjunction with the others.  Combine these three perspectives with a cinematic view that kicks in when flying off bumpers or careening to some new phase of the level.  I sincerely believe that streamlining the game to be one-hundred percent about hauling ass through interesting zones - which is to say, the gameplay they initially pioneered - would not only resolve the technical issues they haven't been able to surmount for the last three games, it would return the focus they lost along the way.

Remember that scene in the Bourne Identity where Matt Damon is running up the stairs in the US embassy and there is that dude at the top and Matt sucker punches him square in the stones? That’s what Sonic Heroes is like. It’s a hard jab right to your Chao farm. 


I think there should be some kind of Mascot welfare service for the videogame industry. You know, so that when there is evidence like this of abuse towards a mascot they can step in and remove the mascot. Maybe even place him with a foster company for a few years. Who knows, if we had a system like this maybe Lara Croft would still be alive today.


I just don’t understand the game industrie's fascination with 3D shit. The goddamn dimension has been around for ever but they act like they just fucking discovered it. When humans started sculpting they didn’t give up painting. Obviously 2D graphics and game play were not an artistic choice 15 years ago. Sonic and his hyper fast game play were born out of necessity. That doesn’t mean it’s bad though. As soon as Sega was able to move Sonic into 3D they did, but what they don’t seem to understand is that the switch to 3D removed everything that made previous Sonic games great. 


Okay Sega, we all know you can create lush 3D environments and detailed character models. How about now you prove you can still make a decent fucking game that isn't a waste of my Goddmaned money. 


Oh, and if the first Sonic game you ever played was Sonic Adventure your opinion is worthless. So don’t bother mailing me with some bullshit about how you actually like Heroes and it’s not as bad as I say.

While I certainly appreciate the passage of the CAN-SPAM Act, and think the people behind it must have been very clever indeed to produce such a name, it is a shame this cleverness was not invested in perhaps a superior bill that would accomplish something akin to its stated aim.  There are certainly tools (or combinations thereof) which the desperate user may stack atop one another to form a bulwark - but I had that stuff before legislators pretended to care about unsolicited e-mail.  Legally, what we need is something mad stringent - something to make those motherfuckers hoof it door to door if they want to talk to me about my dick so bad.  Of course, any discussion of Spam must necessarily include Brad's Outside The Inbox compilation.  Also, Monty Python.  I'm just covering all the bases, I don't want that Monty Python fan writing me that letter in all caps.


You might be interested to see what it looks like when a man comes around to our way of thinking, vis a vis videogames shaping young people into unstoppable ninja assassins.  It looks a lot like this, actually.  I read that just after I wrapped up the Aviara Golf Club with Gabe and his Dad, which was a pretty fascinating experience.  Taken together, these two events seemed profound.  I'd been drinking though, who knows.    


First of all, the things that we now take for granted as gamers are complete technical fucking marvels.  We're in what you might call the ""eye of the storm"" technologically speaking, we follow consumer technology to a certain degree, and though we're surprised from time to time at how how cool this stuff is, if we were not completely acclimated to a certain level of advanced technology some of this shit would knock our heads clean off.  You and me, it's no problem - we'll pop the headset on, load up Roger Wilco, TeamSpeak, what have you, and take our part in any one of a hundred thousand active online games.  


Gabe's dad, just for a point of comparison, could not believe that we could still talk to him even though he'd hung up the telephone.  This guy's smart, and we'd told him about it before, but when you actually witness - and in the case of voice support, wear - this technology, you start to get a sense about how potent these ""toys"" are.  Picturing him putting on that headset, feeling perhaps a little strange, hearing voices and responding to them via a means that he was not entirely sure of - that's a step that I can almost guarantee you doesn't get taken by ninety-nine percent of the cultural crusaders capering hither and yon on the editorial page.     


The next time someone starts talking about how bad Vice City is, as though it were the only game in existence, as though game consoles were only capable of that single experience and nothing peripheral to it, I really do want the opportunity to ask them - please, name another game.  Name one other game that you know about.  No, it's not a trick question.  Well, it is, if by ""trick question"" you mean ""question designed to make you look like an idiot.""  I wonder if they even know that far, far from Vice City, past even the Vice suburbs, the same machine can allow a father and son - separated by three hundred miles and thirty years - the chance to play a round of golf together, for no good reason other than its being Tuesday.

Apparently someone said a bad word.  Someone did not think of the children, as we are often exhorted to do because they are defenseless human larvae.  For our part, we have no authority to discuss coarse language as a social ill.  It has been so long since we could genuinely discern profanity from the mass of other words we employ that we're the last people you should ask whether or not a particular word will plant a demon seed in our young.  

  
It's pretty sick, I know, but outside of the odd bit of Call of Duty with the clan all I've been playing is Zuma.  I don't even mean that as a recommendation, I'm trying to repent.  That's not hardcore.  If I was into Gunbound or something, you know, riding around a triceratops, that's got some credentials.  You can sort of flex the edgy gamer thing there.  But Zuma, I mean...  Zuma.  It's not something you'd want to bring up at a LAN.   


We're working on fully three full-page comic projects at he moment - Painkiller (which Gabe mentioned) has somehow turned out all reverent and biblical, which are words I do not usually associate with the things I write.  My cohort has something of an angel fixation, which his handle makes clear, but despite what you might have heard angels don't really lend themselves to humor regarding the game industry.  He's taking full advantage of this outlet, producing work of a stupefying sort which further attempts to describe would mar.    


The other two projects, I don't even know if I get to say what they are.  One of them takes place on an island and the other takes place largely in the dark.  I'm not trying to tease you with that data, and by the end of the month they'll both be starting up so it won't matter much.    


I finally bit the bullet last night and bought some cards for Star Chamber, hopefully it will shoehorn me off that accursed Zuma.  Similar to Magic Online, opening up a virtual ""pack"" of cards is accompanied by the sound of foil tearing, an audible cue which vibrates on some geek frequency that electrifies the entire surface of my body.  I could certainly open every pack simultaneously, I have that option, it says so - but I open them individually, because every time I hear that sound my back arches and I have to grip my armrests so I don't fire off into space.  I'll cook up a few decks tomorrow probably, maybe hop online and sample the human competition.

Where I was initially resolved to merely tolerate the Van Helsing trailer, the two hundred subsequent viewings have warmed me to it considerably.  Using crosses as weapons is not only reverent, it's awesome.  Van Helsing is demonstrably a bad-ass, even loose coalitions of superheroes and satellites are no match for him under theoretical conditions.  Though, I will concede that the inclusion of absolutely every monster ever does gild the lily a bit.   


I enjoyed the first Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance very much, but when I found out the sequel wasn't being developed by the original Snowblind Studios it dulled my interest somewhat - EGM's 5.5 review didn't help much, either.  I know that it seems like you could just throw a couple players into some place that has a bunch of assholes in it and let them go nuts, and this model has certainly been foisted on gamers more than once - but there really is a trick to making ""mindless hack and slash"" feel as though you are making important, engaging choices.  So, I basically decided that I could hold off on Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, maybe forever.  Then, Gamespot gave it an 8.  I don't know how I'm supposed to interpret that shit, media overlords.  Five-point-five and eight?  Do I add them together?  The game ""ships"" tomorrow, I'll let you know.    


Truth be told, I'd essentially decided to call Champions Of Norrath the actual sequel to BG:DA, as it is developed by Snowblind and uses the same engine anyhow.  I could care less that it's based in Everquest, Sony's efforts to expand that brand always rang a little hollow for me, but four players online with voice support sounds pretty good.  I also have the utmost faith in Snowblind's ability to make even enemies I'm going to see a hundred thousand times unique and interesting in terms of animation and design.  They have produced ""the little engine that could"" apparently, it's used for all the games I've mentioned here, in addition to:   



, which is either a miserable piece of shit or okay, depending on who you ask.  It made no friends among the largely PC oriented gamers that built the franchise for its ""dumbed down"" console action, but since the same things were said about Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and that game was great, so all by itself a break with tradition doesn't really convince me of anything.  I haven't heard much good spoken of it, though - but any game with co-op can be enjoyed under the right circumstances, and it also has submachineguns, you know, which I'm sort of partial to. 




 also takes the fantasy engine into the realm of firearms, and for some reason I have a good feeling about this one.  It's co-operative, like all games that use the engine, and it's World War II, but from a very different perspective than we typically get.  It doesn't arrive until June, but I'm pretty happy with what I've seen so far.     

Moving on.


Two games probably doesn't count as a renaissance, but between Silent Storm and MetalHeart it's just nice to know people remember there is a genre on the PC called Tactical Strategy.

Though it may well ransom my eternal soul, we even now consort with demonic powers in the production of a heinous act of continuity.  I would cross myself, but I can never remember how that is supposed to go, and I don't want to risk hell for doing it backwards.  Consorting with, you know, demons notwithstanding.      


You don't want to hear about my fighter/barbarian, anymore than you want to hear about when the nice lady at the CDC scraped my urethra out with one of their cold metal swabs.  Maybe less, even, so I won't taunt you with it.  I've always thought of my pen and paper inclinations as a sort of rash, as much as I've loved the times I've spent arguing about the encumbrance capacity of imaginary pack lizards I've also been keenly aware of the need to hide it. 

Outside of the occasional announcement of something that looks interesting and will be out in 2006, various press releases, and carefully metered media, there just doesn't seem to be much of interest going on at this particular moment.  There's this thing masquerading as news about UT2k4 not being network compatible with UT2k3, I don't know, maybe somebody's interested in it.  I just reinstalled 2k3 to play with the crew I'm running with these days, and I'll be God Damned if you can find a game worth playing in.  Network compatibility or no, I don't have any reason to believe that's going to change much, regardless of what number follows the U, T, 2, or K.      


It was a problem even when the game was Brand God Damned New, and the reason for it is really strange.  Unreal Tournament 2003 had a truly insane amount of content right out of the box, and then subsequent bonus packs added even more gametypes - in my server browser, I see Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Capture The Flag, Bombing Run, Invasion, Last Man Standing, and Mutant.  Now, in addition to this truly unprecedented and theoretically desirable situation, we add a miraculous invention from an earlier Unreal game - mutators.  These are small bits of tender code which can do small things (like make your head get larger when you shoot people) or large things (remove all weapons but one, and make that weapon kill any person with a single shot), but the latter example - called Instagib, is extremely popular.  Personally, I wont play on a server that has it.  It's not something that I enjoy, so I avoid games that play with it on.  Moving on though, UT2k3 has probably the best mod support ever - maps, models, whole games just get grabbed automatically.  But you don't always know that you're going to like a given mod, and you don't know that until you play it, and half of the time when you connect to a server these days it just starts sending you ten or so megs of bullshit that you may or may not appreciate.   


The practical upshot of this is that the community online is highly fractured.  Virtually any server you connect to is packed to the gills with bots, and when you do find a server with people on it, they're probably playing some mod, mutator, or gametype that is distasteful to you.  I defended the game to the skies when it came out as you'll recall, and I still like it in its original form.  But things that you'd think of as strengths - a staggering volume of gametypes and content, simple game Mutators that allow for a variety of quirky gametypes, and the ease with which modifications are downloaded - erodes consensus and fragments the playerbase.


The most interesting videogame news I've read lately is this SNK Playmore/Sammy Studios stuff - have you heard it?  First, we heard that SNK was going to move into a more Pachinko Machine Oriented and less Videogame Oriented direction, which is fine if you like pachinko and fuck all if you like anything else.  Don't play a lot of Pachinko myself, I live in America.   


Then, things started to get weird - check out this article at SNK-Capcom.com, which begins by drawing on a fascinating internal rumor and proceeds to analyze the entire affair.  It's pretty magnificent.  At any rate, go read it, but here's the long and short of it:  it suggests that SNK Playmore is going to offload its extremely significant intellectual property to Sammy Studios, who you know about because they recently told Sega to stick largely to arcade games after purchasing a controlling interest in the company.   


Sammy Studios.  Aside from this gothic wild-west thing you've been hearing about, they're also the Guilty Gear people, the ones who struck with such artistry and precision into the staid conventions of 2D fighting.  With beloved franchises like Metal Slug, Samurai Shodown, Mark Of The Wolves, and King Of Fighters - coupled with the will to move them off of the aging Neo Geo hardware, and the skill to modernize that traditional genre - the possibilities implied by this leaked information are almost breathtaking.     


I don't have any problem with the Neo Geo as a system, just to clarify my last statement - but I don't ride a horse to the grocery store just because I revere some idyllic historical period.  It's time for those games to graduate off that ancient platform.  And Sammy's the one to do it.

It is precisely because of things like this Nintendo DS stuff that continuity in a gaming comic is inadvisable.  Profound events emerge from nowhere, just when you're lacerating your most loyal readers - but we're staying the course.  Did you hear that Thief III will have a third-person mode?  We're staying the course.  


Seriously, though - about this Nintendo D(ual)S(creen) thing.  I don't have anything of import to say, not that it's stopping anyone else - but I really need to emphasize just how little we know about this machine.  Earlier today I had what I thought were two very nice paragraphs full of smart-assed one-liners regarding this largely nebulous announcement, and I've just gotten rid of them because I'd rather not be that person.  The person I want to be sees the potential in all things, even small pieces of plastic.  When I look at a piece of fresh fruit, I want to see the myriad wholesome possibilities inherent in it.  Anything the source object is capable of, I want to envision and subsequently respect that latent potential.


The only trouble is that my mind is telling me that the Nintendo DS is one or two steps removed from the eReader or Virtual Boy, a sort of high novelty bauble absolutely unmoored from sense and convention.  It's like they made a huge cowboy hat with three holes in it in case a triceratops might want to wear it.  The whole thing is ridiculous on the face of it.


See?  God dammit, I already got rid of two paragraphs full of comments like that, and here I am typing new ones.  My favorite article on the Nintendo DS is by Billy Berghammer, who used to run Planet GameCube - it's an interview with Beth Llewelyn, some sort of public relations droid.  What the article makes clear is that they're simply not prepared to release any worthwhile information.  I've heard that Nintendo is announcing another piece of hardware altogether at this year's E3, and I certainly hope that all that pleasant fiction about ""games everyone can enjoy"" and ""a new direction for the industry"" are associated with something else.  At first I thought it was just Nintendo being coy with data, but after that article I wonder if they have any idea what they're doing.  They really shouldn't have announced anything, and God only knows why they did.  The only way to prove a concept like this to people is to let them see it, really let them understand what it's capable of and why it's better.  If all they had the will to do was pop out there with an ethereal press release and then retreat to their cave complex they should have kept their fucking mouths shut. 


Two fairly substantial patches just came out, dense with mechanical improvements and sporting truly substantial changelogs.  You've got the 7710 patch for the enjoyable Unreal 2 Expanded Multiplayer, courtesy of the late Legend Entertainment.  The list of issues resolved by this 72 meg patch is thick, possibly even rich, and I appreciate Legend's tenacity in delivering fixes even after their company was dissolved.  If you have even a tangential interest in XMP, you should also be keeping an eye on the XMP Community Bonus Pack which should be out shortly and includes a deli tray of tender maps and smoky, aged mutators.   


There's also the Savage patch, which they refer to as a ""content update.""  Ordinarily I would perform a wrestling maneuver on someone for calling a patch some other, more diplomatic term, but I'm going to let them have it because what they did is pretty bad-ass.  To begin with, it's also 72 of your Earth Megs - check out this readme, it's like an epic poem about bugs.  Aside from the broken stuff they fixed and many general improvements, they actually added some really sharp new stuff.  First of all, you remember Savage, right?  The FPS/RTS hybrid?  That one.  This patch actually adds a new ""healer"" unit for both sides, new buildings you create them from, as well as improving the visual appearance of many weapons and their projectiles.  Oh, and everything runs better now.  If you have the Savage and it's sort of fallen by the wayside, grab this patch and jump back into a server.  It really is something else.

This ought to wrap up the roleplaying thing.  The group I actually play with was wondering if they might make an appearance, but years of roleplaying experience has taught me that it's really not wise to piss off your cleric.   


I hope you're not going to get all mad if I start talking about Nintendo again.


A big part of the reason the DS thing makes me so mad is that I know come E3 they're going to be like ""Here it is,"" and I'm going to be polishing their knobs again because it will do some fancy thing I didn't expect.  They left out the important things on purpose - it just doesn't add up to me in its current form - and I have other things to worry about, but I keep mulling over their stupid crap.  I fail this save every time, these companies try to start some kind of buzz and I know better but I bite anyway.  I'm always on-board whenever Acclaim wants to tattoo babies or bake dogs for some new game, I'm here talking about their little trick just like they discussed in the boardroom.


See, that wasn't so bad.  And look, I'm about to make it up to you.


Pork and I are playing Gunbound every night lately, a) because it's awesome and b) because we were never able to resolve his machine's issues with Call of Duty.  I would feel bad for him if he weren't running a 1.2 gig machine, which is to my mind somewhat indecent.  As a PC gamer, you need to respect yourself.  Part of that respect is making sure that your clock speed isn't one third of the Goddamn processors out now.  It's something we've talked about, I've told him about these new ""stores"" you can get stuff at and he just cocks his head like an animal.  Anyway, so Gunbound.


I'm just going to put the link to the client at AIX here for you, you can download it while you read the rest of this because every machine that can run it should - and, as a turn-based 2D battle game with the occasional fancy effect, even Porkfry's disgusting altar of shame can manage it.  Take your Scorched Earth/Artillery concept - you choose an angle and the force of a shot - add the Wormsian concept of weapons and power-ups, and then cajole whimsical Asians into drawing and animating each character, their selectable vehicles, and their collectible accessories.  It's not new, by any means - it's one of those quirky online games that has likely endured the ravages of one or more Fad Cycles, like Ragnarok Online or Dinky Bomb.  In any case it's completely free to play, it's addictive, and I'm on there as CWTycho.  The chances of you beating me are pretty good.


I spent all day (and practically all night) Saturday playing Silent Storm and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, and the short version is that they're both pretty great.  The long version I'll foist upon you Wednesday and, who knows, maybe Friday.  I'm wily.  Oh, and also:  do yourself a favor and get a hold of the Iron & Wine album ""The Creek Drank The Cradle.""

My four year wedding anniversary is coming up in March and Kara and I would like to take a really nice vacation together. I know one year is paper and I think four years is volcanic rock, so we are thinking probably Hawaii. Anyway I figured I’d check and see if any of you readers out there happen to be travel agents, or maybe you just own a private jet and a giant mansion in Hawaii that you never use. My previously mentioned anxiety tends to keep my feet firmly on the ground and usually within a few miles of my house. I’ve never actually planned a trip like this before so I don’t really know what’s involved. If you are in a position to help us chart a course to the Hawaiian Islands please contact kara

I've pretty much had it with Gabriel's Goddamn, patchy little beard.  For one thing, it's not a beard.  It's not uniform in any way.  He looks like his prepubescent evil twin.  This isn't some comic shit I'm talking about, I'm talking about this weird almost hair all over his real chin in the real world.    


Moving on from Gabriel's sparse, almost theoretical hairs, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is marvelous.  I really don't know what I was afraid of.  The graphics aren't quite as amazing as they were when the original game hit, but they're more than serviceable, and certainly when a goblin falls over you get the point.


The game also starts at the moment the last game left off, something I applaud, and you are given your pick of the new character classes.  Human Barbarian and Human Cleric, while not available in the first game, they're also not terribly exotic - they're the fantasy equivalent of wheat toast.  After that, they do some great class/race pairings that I just really appreciate.  A Drow Monk?  A Dwarven Rogue?  A Moon Elf Necromancer?  They're choices that are perfectly satisfactory as game avatars, even if you have no affection for D&D as a system.  For the proponent of that system, however, they're fun concepts that satisfy the ""cool character"" requirements even while tipping their hat to the hardcore.     


As for gameplay, I hope it won't shock you but you're looking at about ten hours of hitting things.  That's the long and the short of it.  For my part, they've really done it right.  You have good ranged options, cool melee stuff, ""dual wielding,"" and ability upgrades called ""feats"" which emulate the spirit of actual D&D canon if not always the letter.  There's also the bonus feats earned by satisfying certain quests, in addition to an item construction workshop.  Throw in two bonus characters upon completion, and between that, the three difficulty levels, and reasonable but not ponderous game length there's some replay value there.  It's also cooperative, a fact that could grind the rough edge off (almost) any game.        


The pathing on the Necromancer's little skeleton pal is sort of disappointing, in fact, let's call it garbage.  He's a skeleton, so if he can't keep up with us it's not something I hold against him personally - he doesn't really have any musculature.  But as our undead thrall, he's technically an employee, and we do prize punctuality in our automatons.  


That's the only bad thing I can think of.


So, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, it's out for PS2 and Xbox.  It's a lot of fun, but there's no good reason to play it solo - get somebody over there, put this son of a bitch in the tray and take it seriously.

I would like to set the record straight. First of all my goatee, at least in real life is not patchy or “theoretical”. It’s quite the opposite in fact. I would call it lush, full and with a healthy sheen. 


Second, Tycho cannot grow hair anyplace on his head. Bald since the age of thirteen, the man has no place ridiculing the beautifully kept goatee I myself have managed to produce. 


Occasionally I think it’s important to stress the differences between comic Gabe and myself. I’d say Cartoon Gabe paints a pretty fair picture of what I’m actually like most of the time, minus the latent homosexual tendencies and the stunted beard growth. 


So to recap, my goatee is awesome and Tycho is bald from head to toe like a baby mole.

I am assuming that you all have been directed to the human beat box video. If not here you go. The guy is totally fucking awesome, no doubt about that. He takes a couple of his bits from a guy named Rahzel though. The “if your mother only knew” part is one example. I’m not saying that’s bad I’m just saying that if you liked what you heard you can find Rahzel all over iTunes.


If you have not seen the ""Evening with Kevin Smith"" DVD I highly recommend it. I’m convinced the man is a genius. At one point in the DVD he says that if he ever writes a book he’s going to use a quote from Tim Burton for the cover. The quote was something to the effect of “I’d never read anything written by Kevin Smith” I think. Anyway, I found my quote today while reading a thread about our comic projects over at Evil Avatar. So when you see our first comic book on shelves you will be able to turn it over and see a quote on the back that says:


“Tycho and Gabe continue to revolutionize the field of visual storytelling with their latest award winning comic book, which they also won a Nobel peace prize for.”

World of Warcraft has matured a lot since I saw it two years ago at E3, and what I hear from the more loquacious testers is that even in its alpha state it has more content than they've ever seen in a (whatever acronym for Massively Multiplayer games the cool kids are using now).  I'd like to believe that, because I'm one of the faithful, but Everquest has at least forty expansions out - one of which takes place entirely on the surface of a turnip, where players can do the the sorts of things a person on a turnip would do.  I guess the turnip is evil?  I don't really play EQ.   


We've entered the World of Warcraft beta, like everybody else, though I'm hoping that we both get in or not at all. 


When talking about Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II last week, I implied that you would be hitting things in the game for ""about ten hours,"" a total time estimate that was based on this Gamespot review.  About eight hours into it at that point, I assumed that based on that data I pretty much had it on the run and decided to press on come hell or high water.  At four in the morning, now twenty hours into it, I wondered what the fuck that review was talking about.  Ten hours?  I'm not screwing around in some dark cave, pausing to appreciate each bioluminescent fungus - I'm in there to do a fucking job.  If some sahuagin shaman steps up to me, as they are wont to do, they get their hearts kicked out.  I give mer-men no quarter.  We've even got a spell called Haste, which essentially means we play the game twice as fast - careening between encounters, resolving conflicts, and grabbing loot before it hits the ground.  Every review I've read puts the time to complete it at 12 hours or less, which (just so we're clear) represents half of the game's content.  Half.  I just wanted to make sure I spoke to that erroneous initial time estimate.  You'll have to forgive me for trying to correlate the things said in game reviews with any genuine event.         


We finally got four cubes together in one place, and if there is a word to describe the experience of sixteen player Mario Kart,  I don't know it.  I also don't know how what we planned as a six person, three kart event mushroomed into this eighteen person powwow.  One guy brought a television, we had a projector in another room, and four hours had passed before I regained the faculties to reckon time.  I was exhausted, too - I mentioned something about that fact when Double Dash took sixth in the We're Rights.  This is because one tends to race with their entire body when playing the game, chest tight, fully present moment to moment.  Getting that many people and that much technology synchronized was almost ridiculously complex, akin to building a starfaring vessel with only your feet.  It was a touchstone social gaming experience, though, one that makes pubbing from server seem anonymous and empty by comparison.  It makes other games seem like methadone.


Metroid: Zero Mission was going to be a straightforward facelift of the original game for the GBA, at least, that's the impression they labored to project at E3 - apparently that's not quite true.  My friend Jason wrote up a bunch of stuff based on a conference call he was recently in on for his site eToychest, which I visit along with my other dailies.  Actually, looks like he has a Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles US review up there, too.  He has all kinds of shit.

There's a wonderful snack that's easy to make, the portable party they call the ""cup-cake.""  But who knew that we lived in the long shadow cast by these treats?     


I sometimes wonder if I will ever reach the point where the slipshod garbage at IGN won't enrage me.  


There's an entire paragraph in their Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II review about what a problem it is to switch between special attacks during combat.  I guess the developer must have agreed with that, maybe that's why you can pull the left trigger to access a fully configurable shortcut menu.  Things like that.  It's not even worth me bringing it up by itself, at least, not unless I'm just going to use it as an introduction to some graver sin.  


IGN's Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles review is pretty amazing.  It is as though they had written a review of the sun, but forgot to mention that it was hot.  There are so many details omitted from their calculation of the game that one wonders how, in four pages, they couldn't find the space to mention them. 


Perhaps it's because so much of the review is given over to truly incessant carping about the divergences from Final Fantasy.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fact that needs to come out - this is not a sixty hour single player epic where the protagonist is the dream of a lost city whose dad is not only a real dick but also an immortal monster.  I would be surprised if anyone was still under the impression that Crystal Chronicles was that kind of game.  It's a four player action game, dense with Final Fantasy fan service and extraordinary production values for the genre.  But the mere fact that Crystal Chronicles isn't an RPG in the classic sense, something they could glean from five minutes' play, is held against the game in every conceivable way.  It is as though they were presented with a race car, and then spent an hour criticising all the ways it differed from chocolate cake.         


You know what I hate about multiplayer roleplaying games?  This applies to Massive ones, as well.  You miss a couple nights, maybe a week, and once you get back in your friends are all riding dragons or wyverns or something, they're all level awesome and you're level bullshit.  That never happens in Crystal Chronicles.  Why is that?  Well, because of all the things the reviewer complains about, basically.          


Yes, it's true enough that you do not keep spells from level to level - at least, not at first.  If any character grabs a water orb, they're a water mage now in addition to whatever else they want to do.  If any character grabs a Heal orb, they can heal other players.  You can even drop them out and trade them, as often happened in our group.  You'd have a couple battle mages, a melee guy, and somebody who walked the line.  What if you want one of those battle mages to be in command of the Phoenix Down, to raise teammates from the dead?  No ""white mage"" required.  Even your melee guy could do it - with no explicit classes or even levels of those classes, people can do what they want to and even change their minds halfway through.  Want a more powerful spell?  Have your party cast two or more spells on a foe.  Want to elementally enhance a melee attack?  Cast it as someone charges into battle.  And in higher levels, when you enter an extremely tough spot and have to get by with no magic until you earn it back?  Exhilarating.  Maybe it's just one player that gets to the Phoenix Down and brings the whole party back.  I'm trying to figure out exactly what we're bitching about here.  

There were also cross words for the ""experience"" system in the game, referred to as ""bizarre and unfair,"" and where the reviewer found such assholes to play with is a mystery - though I guess we can presume they work at IGN.  You don't gain levels in the game, so if they're thinking of it as ""experience"" that can be stolen from you in some ""unfair"" manner, it's no wonder they're frustrated by it.  Here's how it works:  At the beginning of a level, you receive a directive that shows up on your GBA.  Maybe you need to avoid attacks by enemies, maybe you need to not pick up items or refuse to heal yourself.  Then, you and your crew rock the house throughout the whole level, collecting the loot you'd expect to - money, magic, food - and some things you might not expect, especially if you read that review.  For example, you can sometimes collect special materials which, combined with the proper recipe, will produce brand new equipment.  You also collect what amounts to stat bonuses - they can bolster you temporarily during the level, but when it's over they're laid out for party members to choose.  This final screen might also include special materials, items that give you more hearts, as this game handles hitpoints in the Legend Of Zelda way, or magic rings that let you have spells permanently - I wouldn't call any of those things ""experience.""  You're then ranked according to how well you did satisfying your directive, which determines who gets ""first dibs"" on any of these bonuses.  There is typically plenty for everybody.  This is where things get bizarre and unfair, apparently, when you are recognized based explicitly on your performance.  If ""merit"" is suddenly a distasteful method for justifying reward, then I'm not sure what to say to that.  I guess I'm sorry that everybody doesn't get a hug at the end of the level.  Jesus Christ.  


The thing is, aside from the special things I mentioned, these bonuses just aren't all that big a deal.  It's cool to have this much defense or this much whatever, but don't forget - this is an action game.  The guy with 20 defense and the guy with 40 defense are both going to take damage from the big monster if they wander into its maw.  Also, and here's where the asshole portion comes in: if you need something, why don't you just work that out with the group?  This isn't deathmatch, where you need a leg up on your opponents - you're going to need every one of these motherfuckers when that huge orc comes out.  Guys on the frontline need the hearts, problem solved.  This shit is only complex if you play with a bunch of dumbfucks.       


The review disregards the creation of items, the role your family plays, the letters home, how dungeons can change significantly from year to year, how gravity spells can down extremely dangerous birds, and no mention whatsoever of the minigames.  I doubt that in their whirlwind tour of Crystal Chronicles they even saw any of these things.  I'm completely infuriated - the ""annoying"" chalice, a.k.a., The Bucket?  You mean, the one that keeps your party together?  I guess it is pretty annoying, especially when you're all going the same way and working together to defeat fabulous beasts in one of the most beautiful games available for any system.  Yeah, it's super annoying.  


It all becomes clear when you understand that a professional reviewer's objective isn't to complete the game - their objective is to complete their review.  In order to do that, some combination of codes, strategy guides, or FAQs are no doubt employed to lubricate the trying, time consuming gaming that is their cross to bear.  Look at them now, beaten and bloodied, hauling a Gamecube trailing four controllers down the Via Dolorosa.  A game's greatest crime to a person in their position is that it be inconvenient, which Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles unabashedly is.  You need to hook up GBAs to it.  You need to carry a chalice.  You need a bunch of people.  It's sometimes very difficult.  You know what else?  It's also very rewarding - at least, when it it's not your job to endure it.

Many people wrote into tell us about the Playstation 3 that recently appeared (and then disappeared) from eBay.  We were like, Playstation 3?  That old thing?  Man, we're past that shit.       


We were at the Nintendo Store on Wednesday, and while Gabriel massaged his new copy of Crystal Chronicles I was pleased to pick up Metroid:  Zero Mission.  


As a gaming demagogue, I feel like I should have some kind of stern position on the idea of videogame remakes or ""re-imaginings,"" but there have been some stellar examples of the form in recent years - and in any case, I certainly prefer them to half-assed sequels.  We were more than happy with the new Resident Evil, for example - it was like getting a game we loved back.  Zero Mission is another example of why it's a good thing.  Let's differentiate these offerings from straight ports of ancient games, the more transparent cash grabs floated on their bulging catalogs and our endless nostalgia.  


Metroid: Zero Mission is really, really easy on the eyes.  I felt like Metroid Fusion looked pretty good, and it did, but we're talking about another level of sure design and crisp art.  However, this game is also easy on other sensory organs, with great versions of classic tunes to keep you company as you explore a sometimes familiar and sometimes very different Planet Zebes.  Metroid as a ""form"" is well established at this point:  the idea is to make you feel very lonesome as you explore organic and mechanical realms, grafting more and more hardware onto your suit as you go, all the while testing it out on the creatures who live there.  That it remains fresh in every iteration is our good fortune.


Is anyone else invigorated by the torrent of Tribes stuff that just came out?  It's not brand new, by any means - it's just taken a me a few days to even digest it.  I'm assuming that Tribes fans already have all the information, but they've made many changes to the gameplay specifically to attract those of you who never caught the bug in the first place.  Imagining an enemy plucked out of the air by fanciful, future weapons, the interactions dictated by Havok physics are like a form of pornography that caters to an extremely specific clientele.     


One of the greatest things about Tribes was that, if you wanted it, there was an extremely rich fiction that anchored the entire setting.  It ran through three whole franchises, actually - you had Earthsiege (which became Starsiege), Missionforce: Cyberstorm (the hex-based tactical cousin), and then Tribes itself - take a look at the full timeline if I've begun to intrigue you.  The Starsiege Timeline has actually been seized by the Mod Community, leading up to a planned mod for Tribes: Vengeance called Starsiege: 2845 that significantly builds on the fiction in ways that don't just show the proper deference to canon, but makes bold moves of its own.  Tribes: Vengeance takes place centuries before the original Tribes, and when I heard that Imperials would be making an appearance I must admit that I became giddy, as anyone familiar with the timeline would - the inclusion of a real single player campaign means we'll get to see these story elements front and center.  Go read that preview, already.

I won't even waste time trying to appear neutral about Star Chamber.  It's an interesting, original game that I was proud to have sponsor the site.  I talked about it a bit during the holidays, when its ability to run on virtually anything served me in good stead.  It has a lot more going for it than just its egalitarian position on hardware.       


Imagine a game where you manage a Star Empire, the genre we refer to as ""4x.""  Abstract that out so that the galaxy itself is explicit from the start - each planet and the routes between those worlds are connected by a number of spaces, like a board game situated in deep space.  Each potential galactic despot begins play as one of nine distinct races, with a homeworld, a scout, and a few citizens at their disposal.  Barren Worlds, Industrial Worlds, and Artifact Worlds float awaiting colonization, as ships and citizens produced by your planet move to populate the board.  There are three ways to win the game - the ""Military Victory"" entails you sending a fleet to your opponents homeworld, boiling their seas with the experimental orbital platform ""Black Sun.""  You can achieve what is known as a ""Cultural Victory"" by accruing thirty more destiny points than your opponent.  Finally, you can achieve a ""Political Victory"" by winning three Power Play votes in the Star Chamber.  The Star Chamber itself is a planet that no-one can own, and every six turns important votes take place there with ramifications for each of the three victory conditions.  The Power Plays I just mentioned are, of course, one of them - but there are also Alien Support votes, which can produce Destiny, and a final vote that can give you free Peacekeeper attack ships.  The thing is, under ordinary circumstances you only get a number of votes equal to the number of citizens you have at the Chamber itself.  It's an interesting way to work in the Galactic Senate element, I think.  I have a feeling there are very few Power Play victories, but I don't know that for sure.  Just a hunch.      


Oh, that's right, I forgot to mention the most important part:  it's also a collectible card game.  So in addition to the game I mentioned above, there is an entire card game that modifies the events I've described.  It's also one of the main ways the races are distinguished from one another, as different cards draw on different fields of research that are roughly analogous to mana in Magic: The Gathering.  


Once I returned home, I went what you might call ""whole hog"" and purchased a box of boosters online.  It probably wasn't necessary to buy so many, and you could certainly enjoy yourself in Star Chamber for less.  But the game itself was free, and a box of boosters was fifty bucks, and it seemed to me that I've paid fifty dollars for a game at retail before and detested every moment.  The least I could do was pay the same amount for a game that had given me a lot of fun for nothing.    


There are elements of the game's presentation that are somewhat primitive.  Mercifully, it does allow you to turn off the sounds they've included, sounds which can pierce the eardrum and cause you to bleed from your head.  The cards could do with some anti-aliased fonts, things are just a little rough around the edges.  But really, as a subset of a subset - a space empire game which is also a CCG - erring on the side of gameplay probably won't lose them a single player.  Odds are good that the people this game is designed for will come to terms with those issues.         


I finally worked up the courage to hop in a channel last night and play a couple games, having whet my appetite for interstellar domination on the AI opponent for weeks.  Training against that AI was like beating up your little sister in preparation for a heavyweight fight, it was worse than doing nothing because now I had the stay-puft ego, fed to bursting on illusory victories.  I ended up against MisterOrange, who has written a few strategy articles over at SCWatch as it turns out, and he took me to school with a card I just traded him.  That made me feel like kind of an asshole, I wasn't crazy about that exact moment.  


Even with just the racial starter decks, you could have a lot of fun just installing it and playing against friends.  That doesn't cost shit.

You play a game like Champions of Norrath - any multiplayer roleplaying game, really - and pragmatism must sometimes trump fashion.  Of course, that rarely keeps your fancy elf friends from flipping you shit about it, as though their pretty circlets were somehow the emblem of masculinity.


Speaking of Champions, actually - it's pretty good.  I'm fresh off Dark Alliance 2, and having played the entire second half of that game under the effects of the Haste spell the default movement speed here is like wading through hip-deep peanut butter.  It's not as cool as it sounds, believe me, though I'm sure I'll come to appreciate it  once we have four players to keep track of.  I liked how Dark Alliance 2 did away with ammunition for ranged weapons and made party gold a shared commodity, but I like how Champions lets you have four simultaneous customizable characters and play online with full voice.  Snowblind clearly knows best how to coax their engine into producing marvels, and I'm looking forward to playing this one through - online, or off.    


Checking SCWatch a couple days ago, I noticed that Star Chamber was the runner-up for Strategy Game of the 2003 over at DIY Games, and it occurred to me that if a game were to beat Star Chamber it would have to be pretty God damned good.  I'd love to be able to tell you whether or not it was, but my Massive Assault experience thus far has been ""sub-optimal.""  


I'm not in any position to even tell you if it's a good game or not, I can't tell you if the vaunted ""Secret Allies"" system really does constitute an original concept because I can't make the game work.  I downloaded the demo, and playing through just three of the tutorial missions was enough to tell me that it was a game I needed to own.  No complaints graphically, a rarity for the genre.  It's turn-based.  Turn-based and hex-based.  What else do I need to say, really.    


I mean, aside from the fact that the copy protection keeps the game from running on my system.  Determining that life was too short to waste on this kind of crap I proceeded to do it anyway, trawling forums and swearing creative new oaths.  Then, I went out to the living room and played Culdcept, R-Type Final, and Champions of Norrath on the PS2.  So if you want a review of me trying to play Massive Assault, I'm going to give it tens all the way across.  Every game I ended up playing was one anybody could be proud to own.


They were great, but you can't play space shooters when you want turn-based strategy and expect to emerge from the experience satisfied.  Around midnight, I just tracked down a cracked version of the executable.  All that did was trade the initial problem for some kind of sound issue that hard locks the system, probably due to the illegitimate exe.  At this point I hardly care if in my desperation to use the product I purchased I turned to unauthorized code.  I would have preferred to talk today about how independent developers are breathing new life into genres the big industry players shy away from, but instead we have to talk about how even small publishers turn to software which locks legitimate users out of software they rightfully own.

Despite anything we might have said in the strip, Unreal Tournament 2004 is pretty good even if you decide to settle for human company.  I don't retreat from any of the things I said regarding the balkanized community their many gametypes and options automatically creates.  However, I firmly believe that the path en route to that inevitable implosion will be fantastic!


If you don't already have the demo, there's just no reason not to download it from the official site - they have Linux, Mac and PC versions, so no matter where you work you can play it right there on the webserver.  I'm of the opinion that the network code feels a little cleaner, a little tighter - the ""best case"" scenario feels more solid to me that UT2k3, though I will be the first to admit that ""feel"" is not the most scientific term.  I've read bad reports about the lag and whatnot, but I always leave ""Sodomite's BITCH KILLER"" server at the first sign of trouble, I don't wait around to see my worst fears about network performance validated.  I've seen fire and I've seen rain, at least as it relates to server quality.  I don't know which one of those is the good one.                      


It will hit with over a hundred maps built in, as it includes the content from the previous version.  It will warm my heart to see actual humans and not just psychotic robot butchers populating my favorite maps again.  Judging by the server lists I've seen, the new Onslaught gametype - a vehicle oriented capture point mode - has really seized the imagination, and we can expect nine maps right out the gate.  Assault - a mission oriented mode that always had a strong following - hits with six maps, which seems anemic to me.  They're easily the most elaborate sort of map to produce, as they include a whole point by point mission flyby and tend to have elaborate ""fiction"" that describes them, so six probably isn't terrible out the gate.  About other companies, maybe you couldn't say it - but Epic and Digital Extremes keep the content coming, loads of it, well after release - it is almost inconceivable to me that we wouldn't see those six maps expanded through their now legendary Bonus Packs.  No other game has this kind of history, where the things any other company would shake you down for they give away free.      


And also, I have to say - we haven't seen the fanciest of the updated content with this demo.  There's an Assault map, for example, where one team flies spaceships to breach a base in the initial phase.  There's a ton of new features, too - they're just cool ideas.  Text to speech, for example.  And, at any moment, you can hit a button and receive a helpful trail that will lead you to either base.  Voice support.  Not just voice support for online games, but also voice recognition for ordering around your bots - ""kill them, my robots,"" etc.  For me, voice support isn't the biggest deal for a PC game because I'm typically playing with other people using Teamspeak.  More often than not, unfettered access to a voice channel leads to people saying shit like ""Macaroni,"" and then giggling.  But I know the kids like it.     


When's it ship, though - sixteenth of March?  I'll probably have to get that.

268,2004-02-18,Ender's Game(s),"
It's easy to imagine the cool games that might be spawned by an Ender's Game movie, unfortunately, I doubt those will be the ones we see.  It seems to me the odds of us being sodomized in this endeavor are very high.


It would appear that the wheel has come full circle again, and one of us has begun to question their gamer identity.  I want to assure you that this is completely normal and that despair is not your only recourse.  There are two powerful forces operating on your person, and if you let them they will wrest from you the ability to enjoy this passtime.  I speak from experience - you might recall The Sucking series, when we indulged ourselves in the very emotions that have seized you.   


External:  You may be tempted to give ground to the notion that the ""innovation"" is gone from gaming, like the part-time pop nihilists to whom all Internet argument is ceded.  This is a hipster's gambit, and it's one you would do well to apply a belt sander to.  What you are saying is that you are incapable of being pleased.  Instead of turning up your nose at the rich feast placed before us, you might ask yourself if you want to be a person for whom nothing is satisfactory.  That's the trick of that position - to become so enamored of your own refined palette that no morsel can surmount your culling mechanism.  Understand that this isn't the same as liking everything.  You can be a huge snob and still be semi-permeable to amusement.  I certainly don't waste my attention on bad games, and there's no need to invest your dwindling time and resources for gaming out of some twisted sense of equanimity.  As far as the white stag ""innovation"" is concerned, if you're looking at the retail shelf you may be hard-pressed to find it at times.  There are a number of reasons this is true, but for the purposes of this discussion just grant that the rigors of production, the development cycle, and the focus on densely packed, quarterly releases can sometimes obscure the good that there is to find.  My point is that if you focus entirely on retail, that's like opening your bedroom door a crack and referring to that visible sliver as ""the universe.""  I don't entertain the notion that Mod Authors - and let's call them what they are, independent developers - are in any way gripped by some malaise, and the release of a sequel to a popular franchise by a gigantic international corporation is not evidentiary of some canker at the core of gaming.  If between four consoles and the personal computer you can't find some way to enjoy yourself, please send me your name and a picture so I can fucking avoid you.  I don't want to catch whatever it is you have. 


That leads into my next point, actually.


Internal:  This phase of the conflict is critical indeed, but also strange and ridiculous in a way.  I've been playing videogames for twenty-four years, as men reckon time.  I identify myself as a gamer.  It's a topic that I can discuss for hours, years in fact, if this website is any indicator.  And so when I felt these sensations approaching, it seemed indicative of a serious personal fault.  Maybe this is what my mom was talking about!!! and so forth.  Maybe it was time to start not liking stuff and time to start...  What, exactly?  What are the other rituals that are, now that I am a man, preferable to gaming?      


Why do I care?


I don't want to disappoint the young people in the audience, but there is not some kind of flaming arch you pass through and then you're an adult and you have to be serious about shit.  It's easy to see from commercials the sorts of activities I should presumably be engaged in, but I'm fairly certain that American manhood is vague, internally contradictory and largely nonsensical.  If I feel like ushering robot legions instead of riding broncos or joining a militia or whatever the fuck, I'm going to usher those Goddamn robot legions and that's pretty much the end of the story.         


This all misses the point if you just think games are boring and don't want to play them anymore.  There's not some gaming high council that is going to exile your ass for crimes against the community, go do something else for a while and if you like it keep doing it.  If you don't like it anymore, then maybe you should come back and do this thing we're doing.  Eventually, it won't matter if you played Syberia or got heavily into masonry.        


Musical links have finally reached the point where it might be dangerous for me to contain them, so here goes.  The indomitable father of Nerdcore Hip-hop MC Frontalot entered this week's Songfight competition, entitled ""Romantic Cheapskate.""  It is excellent like every other song he has ever written.  Also, belated congratulations to recent Songfight victors The Frontalittle Squad, who finally have a site I can link directly to.  Metroid Metal specializes in what I consider to be fairly inspired renovations of those timeless themes, and of course we could always count on Game Over to apply their secret Swedish metal techniques to gaming classics.  Enough good cannot be said about Overclocked Remix, presided over by eternally funky DJ Pretzel - but I found Quinn Fox's version of the Phantasy Star Online lobby music so Goddamned tender that no fork was required.

We've really done everything we can to enrage Infinium Labs, but apparently our efforts up until now have been unsatisfactory.  Hopefully our most recent salvo will warrant the proper response.   


If you've been reading Penny Arcade for a while, you know that from time to time we are sent letters like the ones Kyle and Steve received over at HardOCP.  They're big boys, so they don't need any advice from us.  But you should really take a moment to read the article that has Infinium in such fits.  It's not some new thing, in fact it's over five months old.  You probably read it and then forgot about it in the intervening period.  It's heavily sourced and draws on public record.  The article doesn't editorialize anywhere near as much as it could, based on the data - if they had me as their tireless nemesis, Infinium Labs would need an entire team of lawyers, perhaps hitched together like sled dogs, just to handle the influx from me.  Steve was remarkably even-handed. 


None of this would be happening if these very real concerns were spelled out in Chris Morris' Game Over column, let's get that out the way right now.  Everything in this supposedly monstrous, illegal article is just the sort of basic Due Diligence stuff that their investors should have known already.  The only reason this situation exists is because Infinium Labs thinks they're dealing with an amateur website that's going to go all weak in the knees once the first Cease and Desist hits.  Trouble is, now all that information is back in the forefront again, along with their ridiculous response to it - I've seen it on Ars, The Register, and AnandTech just to name a few - as though the universally reviled ""Phantom"" could withstand more bad PR.       


I received a late birthday gift yesterday from Brenna's parents, one of these automated litter box things.  That seems like a nice thing to do for a person - you're essentially saying to them, ""I recognize that manipulating cat shit is unpleasant.""  I always see this thing in the SkyMall in-flight catalog, and the image in there always seems to imply that the device actually peels cats, devouring those that wander too near its plastic jaws.  Turns out that's not true.  I own the ""Plus"" model, but there's another one designated ""X-VI Mega"" which has a more refined cat shit algorithm.         


Under ordinary circumstances I do not pay much attention to whether or not my cat is shitting.  I have other things that I'm doing, including Origami, which is the Japanese art of paper folding.  Now, that private act is my fixation.  I sometimes berate the cat for not ""doing its duty,"" I roar edicts and gesture gravely.        


The trouble with this machine is that my cat is horrified by it.  You would think that I dragged in a crocodile and asked her to just hop up on there and let it go.  I don't know if it's the shape or what but something about this robotic bin evokes in my cat a primal fear.  The actual operation of the rake or ""shit-teeth"" is also very loud, really loud, it sounds like the device is tearing itself apart.  If I could suggest something to the designers of this machine, it would go something like ""Please make your cat toilets less menacing.  Thank you.""

272,2004-02-24,Comic Books!,"
I made a trip to the comic book store yesterday and I picked up some really good stuff that I wanted to share with you. I used to be quite the comic book reader when I was younger. I stopped reading around the time Image came out and ruined the industry by flooding the market with shitty, over priced books. Occasionally I’ll pick up a copy of Usagi or some random Spiderman Issue but I haven’t really been able to get back into reading comics on a regular basis. I guess that’s just because I didn’t know the right books to read. 


I ended up going to the Comic Stop up in Lynwood. The store is run by a friend of mine who also happens to be the guy in charge of the Emerald City Comic-Con here in Seattle. I felt kind of silly but I told him how I hadn’t read comics in years but I really wanted to get back into them and I asked him what titles he would recommend. He took me on a whirlwind tour of the store, shoving books in my hands and explaining complex story arcs spanning hundreds of issues and multiple titles. I learned all kinds of things, like Image doesn’t suck anymore, Marvel is cool again, Jim Lee drew a years worth of super cool Batman comics, Superheroes can swear now, there is a book about a crow that gives hand jobs, and essentially that comics are rad again. That’s right, I said rad…piss off.


I ended up walking out of his store with some really good stuff. I’ll try and give you the low down on a few of the books I grabbed with out ruining too much of the story for you.


Marvel Knights: The Fantastic Four


Back when I was reading comics this was a corny title that no one read. Well it’s just been re-launched under the Marvel Knights banner (their adult line) and it’s totally awesome. It also just started so you can get in on issue one and not miss a beat. So the FF were off gallivanting around the world taking care of bad guys and when they get home they find out their money manager swindled them out of their fortune and fled the country. They are now totally broke and forced to look for regular jobs. I won’t spoil anymore of it for you, but suffice to say it’s a really fresh take on the characters and super heroes in general. It reminds you that the FF is a family first and a super hero team second.


“Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic, brilliant scientist, intrepid explorer…stay at home dad?”


Wanted


Wesley Gibson is a total fucking loser. His dad walked out on him when he was just a baby. His girlfriend is fucking his best friend but he’s too much of a pussy to say anything about it. He has a shitty job and a complete bitch for a boss who is always giving him shit. Guys on the street make fun of him every day. Oh, and the dad he never knew was the worlds greatest super villain.


Wesley’s dad was “The Killer” the greatest hit man ever. He was part of a sort of Super Villain brotherhood that’s been operating secretly on this planet for about twenty years. When “The Killer” dies he leaves his vast fortune to the son he never knew out of some twisted sense of guilt for having walked out on him. The only stipulation is that Wesley has to join the Meta-Human Criminal Cartel and learn to ditch the “effeminate affections” he’s picked up over the years from his “neurotic single mother” 


INVINCIBLE


I actually picked up issues one through four of this title in the form of a trade paper back. It tells the story of Mark, a kid whose dad is a super hero. The book starts just as Mark discovers his own super powers and starts his career as a super hero just like his old man. It’s a funny book that juxtaposes Marks wild adventures with his dad against dinner at home with his mom and life at school. Mark’s Mom is just like any other Mom. She doesn’t mid so much when she sees her husband on TV battling some giant monster, but she always worries when he gets sucked into another dimension. Now she has to worry about Mark as well and it’s not easy for her. Mark discovers a group of teenage crime fighters, and falls in with them to help uncover the mystery behind missing kids at his school and a recent string of mall bombings. I’d recommend grabbing the Trade and catching up on the entire story so far. 


If you are in Seattle be sure and check out the Emerald City Comic-Con this weekend and check out the Comic Stop up in Lynwood if you decide you want any of the stuff I just mentioned. A few of our wives along with a couple of our friends will be running our booth at the Emerald City Comic-Con this year. It’s a bummer we can’t be there ourselves but if you need PA hoodies, shirts or posters they can hook you up. 


Tycho and I will be taking off for Ubercon in New Jersey this week. We’ve never been to the east coast before and I honestly can’t imagine when we’d go back again. If you are in the area we’d really appreciate it if you come out to the con and say hi. I’ll be doing free sketches and we’ll have shirts, hoodies and posters to sell. We will also be taking part in some panels and getting our asses kicked at all kinds of games. It should be a real hoot!

You might remember that on Monday we said that Tim Roberts, CEO of Infinium Labs can’t have an orgasm unless he kills a dog. Well apparently Tim felt compelled to respond to our comic on the Infinium Labs?EForum. The thread has since been deleted but a quick thinking PA fan was smart enough to grab a screen shot of Tim’s post. Here it is in all its glory:




So Tim thinks we did that comic strip to get more traffic driven to our site. That’s a nice thought Tim but you’re way off. You see unlike Infinium Labs and your doomed console, Penny Arcade is successful. How can I say this without sounding like an asshole? Penny Arcade has more readers in a given second than your site will ever have even if it were to sit and rot on the internet until time ends and the universe implodes. Hmmm, I guess I can’t. 


Tim also says we called him to let him know it’s all in fun. This again is bullshit. I don't care if he likes the comic or not. I've certainly never called the guy and I have no intention of doing so.


Bottom line, the guy is a lying huckster. I guess he figured he could post that on his forum and we’d never see it. This proves he has no concept of how huge PA is. Penny Arcade isn’t just a comic and a news post Tim, PA is a community and we have agents everywhere. Chances are they’re watching you even now.

Every time I leave my house, I do not presume that I will ever return there.  


That isn't an automatic thing that just follows logically for me.  The dense matrix of lethality presented by virtually any region outside of the home should give a brave man pause, but I see people out all the time getting pot stickers or running with their dogs.  Fuck leaving the house, the moment you board an airplane your termination index goes through the roof.  Eating food from street vendors - while not directly comparable to the presumptive festival of hubris that is human flight - certainly ranks above running with the bulls in Spain or wearing a spider as decoration.  What made me obtain that questionable protein from a shifty stranger is anyone's guess.  There are none more aware of the myriad dangers which accompany normal activity.    


In the restroom at the bus station, I could feel diseases leaping from the stall to my penis.  I live in Seattle, I've smelled enough heavy, strange urine to keep me pretty good on that score maybe forever.  But there's something unique about New York pee, perhaps left there by oxen, herds of oxen grazing on garbage, drinking sewage and producing wholly new types of waste.  We went into this public bathroom expecting it to be horrific, we did not expect laboratory conditions, and even then we were amazed at its filth. 


We had gone to New York out of desperation, because Secaucus itself is like the surface of the moon, devoid of life.  It was seriously like some Left Behind, Book Of Revelations type shit, and we mainly wanted to verify that there were other people.  Then, we went to New York, and there were too Goddamn many.  For the recluse, it's really a complicated business making sure there are enough people around to revile without being overwhelmed by the supply.        


We've tapped Emma to help us navigate New York tomorrow.  I'm done finding food on the street and eating it against all reason, I'm ready to approximate a human being with my behavior and appetites.

276,2004-03-01,Ubercon Sketchbook: Epilogue,"
We love this robot, invented in Las Vegas, so he's back to help us wrap up the Ubercon.    

     
Anyone who has seen me walk around an event like this knows that I sort of grin by default - I would say that it felt like a larger Necrowombicon, as both events had a healthy mix of board game and electronic amusements.  The San Diego con is almost too exhausting to enjoy, and I don't know that the Anime con I went to had a pronounced tabletop gaming contingent - but understand that my passion burns hot for games and game systems in general, the fact that I run a website devoted almost exclusively to their electronic subset is not meant to indicate a preference.  I could just as happily run a site dedicated to some combination of strategy miniatures, collectible cards, and pen and paper RPG's, but then I'd have to draw it myself.  And if I were drawing it myself, well, I doubt you'd come to visit, and I'd be very lonely indeed.     


There was a room full of consoles over to one side, and I think I went in there maybe four times over the course of the three days.  Gaming PCs, thirty or so, against the back wall?  Maybe in a minute.  As soon as that d6 hits the table, I'm on the case.  I know the sound of it and possess an unusual organ that detects vibrations of that kind.  I wish that I'd had more time to dig into the Munchkin, Warhammer 40k, or Settlers of Catan games they had going, but my focus at this con (like all cons) is to be somewhere easy to find - also, I didn't bring my Necrons.  They won't let you fly with fucking nail file, so I'm assuming that evil, interdimensional portals are straight out.         


The highlight of the con (and perhaps my entire life) was the Question and Answer panel on Saturday night.  I know I always get sappy after these events, but you will forgive me for never quite getting used to the warmth and affection we receive.  It's not something we think of ourselves as deserving, so then when we get it we're like ""Yes, this is the proper level of adulation.""  It has always been that we find the level of your enthusiasm very surprising. 


There are points of distinction between myself and what you might call the Tycho Persona.  I don't write as a different person or anything, it's not that elaborate, but Tycho can say things with a level of force and assurance that I don't typically see as my domain.  For several minutes of that session, though - perhaps as many as eight - I felt like the capable person I'm able to project here from time to time.

Well we made it back from Ubercon in one piece. I’d like to thank everyone who came out to see us over the weekend. Also a big thanks the Ubercon staff for putting on such a great event!


While we were gone a few more of our Penny Arcade Presents projects showed up online. Page one of Painkiller is now online (click on ""downloads"") for your reading enjoyment. We were given a lot of freedom on this project and I think we came up with something especially cool. You probably already know that the main character is killed in a car accident and ends up serving as a hit man for God. What you might not know is why. Our comic fills in the story immediately after the car accident and before the game really starts. 


Our Far Cry comic on the other hand, is a comical take on the main character Jack and the adventures he has on the island. It’s got Monkeys, mad scientists and explosions. We tried to fit in robot pirates, but we ran out of room.

I just can't get enough of those Infinium guys.  It looks like the HardOCP thing has gone into Round Two, with HardOCP making some concessions which aren't really concessions and Infinium burning down an old folks' home.  I mean, not burning one down.  Now that the lawyers are out, perhaps it's best to be circumspect.  One did burn down, though.  Maybe they did it and maybe they didn't.    


They keep offering to let us check that thing out - the Phantom, I mean - because I guess they have some offices right here in Seattle.  We didn't take them up on it initially, just on principle, but now I really want to see this shit.  I guess I could wait until E3, when their 8000 square foot earthly kingdom comes to rest, but now I can't think of any good reason not to.  I mean, we're best friends, right?    


The way that it works at Microsoft - or so I'm told by people internal to the company - is that at the highest levels, you have a dark fraternity of scaly horrors, who recline on thrones shaped entirely from blood frozen by mortal fear.  Virtually every person who works there, in the caverns gnawed by the she-worm Arbalex, feels so guilty for working at Microsoft that they practically kill themselves to make the best products they can.  So yes, while having a target to rival the glory days of Daily Radar does satiate, I am beginning to wonder if we have a similar conundrum.  Perhaps the people at the top simply enunciate their aims poorly, and resort to the legal solution - what you might call ""the nuclear option"" - with too much haste.  We received a letter from an employee local to us that didn't exactly know what to do, as he enjoyed Penny Arcade but worked for Infinium Labs.  Initially I surmised that death was the only answer.  Perhaps we should actually look upon the work of his hands before sentencing him.  


I remember reading some kind of article yesterday about how there were no new games to play, but I'm typing this news post with the one hand that emerges from a huge pile of them.  Yesterday we picked up Ninja Gaiden and Steel Battalion: Line Of Contact, and in slavering anticipation of the morsel I purchased the strategy guide - yes, the strategy guide - for PSO 3: Card Revolution.  Not sure what happened there.  Ninja Gaiden has been pretty great so far, I'll probably talk more about it in the next couple posts, but yesterday was largely given over to Steel Battalion.


Steel Battalion:  Line Of Contact, when you think about it, actually costs two hundred and fifty dollars plus Live charges to play.  We didn't pay that, you understand - other than the fifty dollars we'd pay to get any other game, we traded in tons of shit to make sense of that purchase.  No matter how you acquire the technology, however, playing it one does have the sense that they are engaged in a truly decadent act, like riding in an opulent litter out to the mailbox.  Gamewise, it's the sort of thing you need to own in order to make your initial purchase even the slightest bit sensible.  You might be startled to find, as I was, that there isn't a lick of single player content.  For what amounts to an online-only expansion pack, I'm of the opinion their price point is a bit greedy - but I doubt it kept them up at night.  Think of the first Steel Battalion as them having sold a set of limited edition, solid platinum scepters - odds are good they can charge whatever they want for the decorative, topaz encrusted pommel.           


The experience of playing the game is, to my mind, very interesting.  A clan could take this game very seriously, with its tradable insignias, tradable replays, voice support and an online campaign mode.  Riding towards conflict with your teammates, your VT locked in fifth gear as you skim across the desert is tangibly unlike other game experiences.  On the radio with your compatriots as you initiate your elaborate startup sequence, one does get the impression that something important is about to happen.  Whether or not that important thing ever actually occurs depends largely on whether or not you liked the first Steel Battalion.  The pace of combat is much more deliberate that many mech games, and it can be difficult to ascertain just how much fun two hundred and fifty dollars is supposed to be worth.  That's why I recommend, as I did initially, that you do as we did - buy it with friends, heavily subsidized by old games you no longer play - so that price issue doesn't linger.  You can negotiate visitation rights with your people and enjoy the device as a crew, as we've determined the best way to play it is to have someone around to appreciate the awesome shit that you just did.         


There are some networking issues that keep you from joining many games, so even though we found many more games out there than I would have expected we were kicked from the large percentage of them.  I'm hoping that this is something they can resolve.  Purchasing a game of this dollar amount, even if I didn't spend a whole lot of actual dollars, and then having it not function properly is something like buying a Dodge Viper at full price and then discovering that it's made out of paper mache.

279,2004-03-05,If It Ain't Broke,"
Picked up Phantasy Star Online 3 Wednesday, and it ain't bad.  Humans seemed surprised when I claimed enthusiasm regarding the card-oriented gameplay shift, heresy of heresies, but by now it's probably clear that I could replace anything, everything in the world with a card that represents it and feel nothing but pleasure.  Conceptually, yes, I do like the idea that the events of even the prior PSO games could be described by the card metaphor - that the structures and definitions retain meaning across a mechanical shift.  As all this poetry here might imply, I was ready and waiting for a new interpretation of the game.       


Gamespot's review calls the game a ""conundrum,"" which is something we agree on, though we differ on why.  They say it's because they've switched up the game metaphor for this card thing, which makes it difficult to recommend straight across to PSO fans.  I say it's because they have a pretty cool card game that is encased in mediocre graphics and suffers from a primitive user interface.  Envision a creamy game at the center of some foul tasting lozenge you must suck with determination and you will be very near the heart of it.    


Visually, PSO is aging like a corpse in the sun.  It was always difficult to tell from released screens or whatnot if any improvements had been made to the characters or creatures in the game.  I'm here to tell you definitively that it's not true - as though selling practically the same PSO over and over again weren't enough, now they have made a new game, smuggled in all the old art and hoped no-one would notice.  There are beautiful cutscenes that use new illustrations, try to enjoy them as much as you can because aside from the static battle rooms that's pretty much what you get.  Much of the art for the series has always been interesting and imaginative - with a turn based battle system, why they didn't take the opportunity to really envision their world is a mystery to me.  The game doesn't ease you into play at all, either - a series of obtuse menus, like gates of fire, will haunt you.  


Of course, the O stands for online, but without any kind of voice support, no keyboard, and monthly charges I don't know how much of that I'm going to get into.  It has the lobbies PSO fans already know about, you can do battle with other players and take missions on the world just like you might have in the other, prehistoric versions.    


The game at the core is a pretty interesting hybrid card game, which is why the presentation and menu systems irk me so much.  I say Hybrid because you've got some movement and placement issues like you might have in tabletop strategy, in addition to any card oriented shenanigans.  Luck is a part of any deck based card game - will I get my 4/4 Shieldbearer Munchkin in time? - but there's another layer of luck in PS03, the Action dice.  The Attack and Defense points you have to play cards and attack are determined by random rolls, so it is entirely feasible that you will never roll well enough to do anything substantial.  This happened to me yesterday, in fact.  Deck builders will likely rejoice in the two distinct sides, Hero and Arkz - the former may equip the items you know from PSO, the latter may summon the creatures you remember from PSO to do battle.  In our own tests, a new Hero character will pretty much beat a new Arkz character every time, which we're thinking is just a distortion created by the limited decks in play.       


It's not a bad game, but it's not as easy to get into as it should be and the level of recycled content is almost unconscionable.


Ninja Gaiden, as it turns out, was rather a sound investment.  I didn't know quite what to make of the demo, as I'm sure came across.  It was hard to know if what I was seeing was a template for an entire game or merely an introduction, if I was going to see these same dumbass ninjas in every corner of the globe this probably wasn't a place I wanted to go.  They switch it up on you almost immediately, though - coming at you with multiple types of opponents simultaneously that will pierce you with a spear from horseback and then drag you around behind them.  That's not an allegory I'm making, that actually happens - and it's not even a boss, it's just some asshole riding around on a horse.


It's the sort of game you might have played with a friend of yours around, a friend like a ripcord, to be entrusted with the controller once you reached realms too difficult to surmount.  It's got that kind of difficulty.  It's also got that kind of satisfaction when you kick off a horse guy and, in the manner of a cultural festival, demonstrate for him the deadly arts of the ninja.        


I keep typing ""there are issues with the Gamera"" for some reason, implying that there is a problem with our ancient monster turtle.  He's fine.  There are issues with the camera, however, but I'm so tired of having to mention that the camera in a Japanese action platformer is bad that I would like you to please assume that the camera is terrible in whatever game I'm talking about.  If I were to talk about caramel, you'd understand that I meant a golden, chewy candy without my having to resort to specifics.  Let's get to that point with these Goddamn cameras.  I mean, am I the problem?  Is my burning desire to see the enemies attacking me a part of some dark and undefined complex?

Shit damn Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your friends will die.  It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before.  Those guys are feather pillows compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later. 


For a geek, my resistance to gadgets is extremely high.  I wish that I could say that it is because I know only too well the speed with which obsolescence grips that genre of consumer technology, making my reticence in this regard a function of great wisdom as regards largely unnecessary but indubitably sensual equipment, but that's not quite right.  I waited until Internet capable cell phones had large screens and full, comfortable keyboards before seriously considering one, which I thought exhibited the utmost restraint in the face of such pleasures.  Instead of it being particularly wise or pragmatic, it's more that I believe if I wait long enough they will eventually put all the devices that have caught my eye into the same machine.  I only want to go to the store once. 


I like my Hiptop quite a lot.  It's an excellent, ergonomic data device and a passable phone.  Jay-Z owns one, and I think of myself as tasting the player lifestyle each time I send a text message to my dogs.  Mainly, though, it's friendly.  It is never mean to you, and the way that it works makes sense to most people.  My wife Brenna has one and loves it, which is odd because she has said (perhaps not in as many words) that technology is a force for evil in our world.  That the Hiptop won her over is a feat all by its lonesome.  On the other hand, the idea of that phone as a fully functioning ""platform"" really hasn't materialized for end users.  There is a development kit available, but regular humans never really taste the fruits of those endeavors, and the company is too secretive about the future of the platform to interest me in waiting around.  The customization options common on even the most basic phones don't exist here.  Unfortunately, now I'm hooked on a large color screen and sizeable qwerty-style thumb-board.  I need something that does all the stuff I have now, only it's hooked into a major platform like Palm or PocketPC for apps and is more comfortable to hold against my face.     

      
Basically the MPx is the phone that springs fully formed from my head.  It can do every last Goddamn thing that occurs in your science fiction communicator wet dreams.  They aren't even saying how much it will cost yet, which is nice for me, because it lets me imagine I'm the kind of person who could own one.   


I have no idea why sites persist in utilizing RealMedia compression when there are viewers that molest a user's machine to a much lesser degree.  It would be one thing if installing Real's stuff didn't involve braving about four hundred menus, each one of them dense with peril, you can tell it not to do shit but none of those buttons are hooked up to anything.  Every now and and again I'll find a questionable video that I'm willing to install it for, but once the novelty of sex in zero G or the lego version of Star Wars wears off I uninstall immediately.  Well, there's a player that watches Real video that I don't mind leaving on anymore - check out the Real Alternative if you too are fatigued by the cycle I just described.  Apparently they also deal in Russian brides.  I wonder if there is a way that I could know true loneliness.  Oh, I know - I'll marry a foreign woman who secretly despises me.

Digital Extremes just sent me a press release about their new title, Pariah. Generally I don’t post this sort of thing here but they attached some really cool screen shots. Here is a snippet from the release:



Top independent game development studio, Digital Extremes and global interactive game publisher, Groove Games today announced their partnership on a new first-person action game based on an original intellectual property created and owned by Digital Extremes. Best known for creating the multi-million unit selling Unreal® franchise, Digital Extremes has set the standard for fine-tuned gameplay and technologically impressive graphics in the first-person action genre. With such award-winning hits as Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship, Digital Extremes is looking beyond the Unreal universe and is working to raise the bar again. The new game, ominously named Pariah™, has been quietly in production for the past two years and is currently planned for the Xbox® video game system from Microsoft and the personal computer.

If the internal browser is any indication, they've really struck a chord with Unreal Tournament 2004's Onslaught.  It certainly struck a chord with me.        


I wouldn't say that it's as innovative as XMP, it doesn't take anywhere near the chances Unreal 2's Expanded Multiplayer does.  That's all well and good, but I never succeeded in converting any of my friends to its unique gameplay, not even after multiple weeks of evangelism.  Onslaught, on the other hand, doesn't require any speechifying.  There's only two tricks: using Link Guns to build or repair nodes, and capturing points that connect all the way to the enemy core.  I mean, there you go.  That's Onslaught.        


And who could say that the combination of large maps, vehicles, and fast action did not bring them back to the heady days of the original Tribes?  The upcoming Tribes: Vengeance excites at the mere mention of it, and though I bear considerable faith in Irrational it remains to be seen how exactly their interpretation will shake out.  In the meantime, though, I believe it is fair to think of Tribes as the pure product ingested at the finer clubs and Onslaught as the condensed, possibly adulterated substitute available on the street corner.


People seem happy to have Assault back as well, but if the other Assault maps are anything like the desert raid in the demo any official one requires an animated fly-by, voiceovers, and dialogue which makes them a good deal more work intensive than an Onslaught map - that might be why we only get six of them.  I could certainly be wrong, I hope not, but here goes:  it is my impression that Onslaught is going to be a very popular gametype for community map production.  Though the nine maps they included are certainly appreciated, it's my belief that the situation will be rectified in short order by talented enthusiasts and the official bonus packs which have garnered the UT series such acclaim.  After seeing the Community Bonus Pack for XMP, the level of workmanship and aesthetic power, my heart does titter when considering the outlandish scenarios we will soon play out in UT two-thousand four.   


I'm seriously considering pre-ordering it, which goes counter to my very blood but I don't want to miss out on those new Onslaught and Assault maps because the EB up here didn't order enough copies of a game that's clearly caught fire online.  It's a big decision and I might need to sleep on it. 


Just as an aside, I played a fair bit of Unreal Tournament - 2k3 and 2k4 both - at a LAN party for a friend of mine's dad.  That's what he wanted to do for his birthday, have a LAN party.  No, I'd never heard of it either.  Turns out his whole Goddamn family loves deathmatch.  A couple rounds of Onslaught later, they were linking beams and busting nodes like professionals.  Earlier that night (during a particularly frenetic round of Deathmatch on Phobos II) his mom chastised him, saying ""Clint, I think your mother deserves better than to be killed by the translocator.""  


That's really not something I ever expected to hear.

I was amazed to find that Charles was the most requested sketch at the Ubercon.  Why does the East love him so?  I have no idea.  At any rate, after our recent experience at the Apple Store it seemed like a good opportunity to utilize the character and (potentially) bring pleasure to an entire coast.   


If you want to coexist with different breeds of geeks, you need to adopt a value-neutral approach to the platforms.  So, while there are many conversations one can have regarding different computing methods, I typically do not choose to have them.  Gabriel and I no longer discuss God for the same reason - people express themselves via means as divergent as spirituality and operating systems, so as soon as the topic starts to get interesting it invariably becomes personal.  Obviously, that has a tendency to occlude rational dialogue.  There might have been a point where I had a surplus of energy to invest in philosophical cul-de-sacs.  I no longer remember it.


The way Apple projects its brand, however, has nothing to do with the underlying technology.  It could not be more divorced from it.  So if they want to create largely empty stores staffed exclusively by young hardbodies in ill-fitting t-shirts, it's open season.  Its possible that each manifestation of this chain does not resemble the others, that each one is not populated with the scrubbed, tousled young things of the sort one sees in serious teen dramas.  You'll forgive me if I don't believe that.  I'd say it's far more likely that there is a single Apple Store, connected by a series of geographically distinct portals.          


I don't put this out there to imply that the places I have to go to get technology or software are somehow superior, because they aren't.  They're horrid.  But at least I never feel underdressed.

I mean, they fight using extrasensory perception.  Just because he can't read the back of a cereal box doesn't make him any less dangerous.     


I've had a couple weeks now with the Littermaid Plus, and I have to say that this is one of the worst designed consumer devices ever made.  I don't have any arguments with the concept - a machine that obviates the need to play with feline waste.  I'm onboard.  Men of science, please invent a machine that will collect and sequester the tiny pot roasts my cat leaves behind.  It is, however, a deeply ironic device, and it has lessons to teach us about sloth and human folly.  Indeed, this strange method of instruction is the only thing it accomplishes with any regularity.  What we learn through using the device is that life is sometimes difficult, and to try and mediate that fact invites the scorn of the universe.          


There is a sort of ""comb"" that trawls the litter, snaring the sweet surprises left within and theoretically deposting them into a sort of cat shit purgatory.  While mostly successful, the waste must first travel up a steep ramp, like the ones in extreme sports videos.  And sometimes it is flung out, as though by catapult, toward imaginary foes.         


The thing is, the device really doesn't have a lot of room in it for cats, which strikes me as a design flaw.  You would think they would try to put a cat in there, or find somebody who had a cat, shit, maybe just imagine a cat and try to design their litterbox around that hypothetical, hairy customer.  But they didn't.  Cats must situate themselves diagonally in order to make a deposit as it were, so the container at the end where it's all supposed to go fills up at the sides first and then boils over into your house.  This isn't even the worst problem.      


Cat pee and litter is like wet cement, it's like a new state of matter.  In an ordinary, non-robot litter box it has time to ""set"" so that you can remove it and then go do something that is important to you.  If, on the other hand, a mechanical arm reaches out and spreads it the length and breadth of the device, now you have a completely disgusting new task you could never have imagined in trade for the one you thought you were giving up forever.   


It is the sort of thing you would design if you had only a vague description of a cat and you didn't really give a fuck if it worked or not.

286,2004-03-17,Vietnam Is Actually Kind Of Complex,"
Jesus, so what do I talk about today?  UT2004 retail?  Battlefield Vietnam?  Pandora Tomorrow?  I know a shit ton about Pandora Tomorrow, I could probably go on all day.  The comic's about Battlefield, though - I suppose that's as good as anything.


I was poking around Battlefield Central when it became entirely clear the game was probably out, and I should go buy it.  The guy at the Northgate EB knows not to ask me if I preordered it, we have an understanding on the issue.  I told him once that maybe down in San Francisco they pre-order their games, and that's good enough if you live in San Francisco, but here in America we don't abide by that kind of nonsense.  He and I are resolved that it's a lifestyle choice, it's something I tolerate but I'll be God Damned if they make me equate it with a regular purchase.      


Battlefield 1942 is, I believe, second only to Counter-Strike in terms of its online popularity.  Unreal Tournament 2004 will make a splash I'd warrant, but B1942 is real, real big.  There are also demos available for it, if you have just returned from the mines of Pluto and are out of step with the interactive entertainment that has taken root while you sailed between worlds.  The reason I establish this is because I don't want to spend a whole post talking about Battlefield.    I don't want to be up here saying, ""Now, footballs can be distinguished from shuttlecocks in the following ways.""  There is some basic shit I expect you to know when you visit my site.  And if you do not, I will recoil from you, as though having touched the greasy, third-party gum beneath a barstool.


What we will be talking about are the points of distinction between the original Battlefield that so many people love, and this new contraption that will undoubtedly inspire a breadth of opinion.  We will not be piercing the moral quandaries at the heart of the conflict, discussing the military language of the period, or dealing with factual accounts of Vietnam.  Well, except for one thing:  my stepdad says that the way he and his guys would fish in 'Nam was to press a grenade with the pin pulled down into a jar of peanut butter.  They would then drop this jar from a great height via helicopter, and he tells me that when the jar hit the surface of the water and cracked, the grenade was released and the resultant shockwave of water, glass, shrapnel, and I assume peanut butter would either kill fish or just kick the shit out of them, causing them to float where they could be scooped up by the Huey.  Okay, that's all the facts.  No more, that's it.


If you purchase Battlefield Vietnam, install it, and then run it with the expectation that you will not be driving vehicles around on hilly terrain while you shoot guys, you will be in for a shock.  We are talking about an incremental shift in the way the game is played.  This may fill you with rage, and cause you to write a review of this nature.  Outside of some animation bugs and the fact that my American soldier can't stop speaking Vietnamese for some reason, I'm actually pretty happy with it.  They made some changes to the way the Conquest mode works that I think make it a better game.  But this is not Battlefield 2, and you will be disappointed if that is the context you see it in.


The ability of a single individual to run roughshod over the countryside, snaring points willy-nilly and generally pulling army-of-one style bullshit has been hampered somewhat.  The number of people you have at a given point determines how fast a point is captured, so moving groups of people into points is encouraged in ways that did not exist prior.  Going a step beyond the idea of mobile spawn points already introduced by mods and official expansions, there is a placeable spawn point that can be picked up by a helicopter and dropped off anywhere.  The North Vietnamese have a ""tunnel"" (a la C&C Generals' GLA) that they may move from place to place as well.  Helicopters aren't only limited to moving spawn points, of course - they can also grab vehicles and haul them to other parts of the map.  I think that's really hot, though it requires a level of player collaboration that I haven't seen much of in my first few rounds - I think people are still getting used to the game.        


The different boats, tanks, planes, and jeeps will probably be very familiar to you, and with the exception of heat-seeking rockets in the aircraft (or carried by NVA troops) you will not be caught off-guard.  On the other hand, the helicopters I mentioned are fairly significant - particularly if you have not played Desert Combat.  They may surprise you even if you have played the popular modern combat modification, because controlling them is a far more humane procedure in Battlefield Vietnam than you might be familiar with.  The Gamespot review refers to the difficulty of managing these craft, and while they might be difficult compared to jeeps, I only had to crash one or two before I got the hang of it.  To compare, flying helicopters in DC is like bending a spoon with your mind or trying to walk a tyrannosaur.  To say they are unwieldy is to have a good shot at Understatement Of The Year.  


The classes have been condensed significantly, down to a Soldier, an Engineer, an Anti-Armor, and a Sniper.  I'm all for it, there used to be too many - but it does create a balance issue Ivan talks about in the 1up review I mentioned earlier.  There is a US Anti-Armor class that gets a LAW as well as an M60, which is to say that they are Gods of Destruction.  Since the ""on foot"" gameplay has always been of a very high lethality index in this series, there's no reason not to just take this class every time and act as the agent of divine retribution.  Between your disposable rocket launcher and your heavy machinegun, you represent a buffet of death that is open twenty-four hours a day.       


The things that I like best about BV aren't related to gameplay so much as they are related to immersion.  Gameplay wise, we're talking about Battlefield 1942 with tufts of foliage and a few visual tweaks that look as though the engine has consented to modernity, albeit begrudgingly.  You can shoot from the passenger seat of jeeps, plant mortars like in Desert Combat...  It's fine.  Single player is garbage, just as it was in days of yore.  If they can rein in that glaring balance issue, it recommends itself pretty well at its thirty five dollar price point.  I think they have a sense internally about exactly how much we will pay for what is essentially an extremely professional mod.  


Sound-wise, though, the aural environment is extremely intense.  Weapons, vehicles, ambients, all accurate and genuine and harrowing.  They licensed several ""period"" songs for the title which perfect the presentation, and you will hear these songs blaring from helicopters as they pass by with full Doppler effect.  When you read about it, maybe it doesn't seem like much.  To actually bring up the song list in your vehicle online and choose a song that everybody can hear is a very powerful feature in practice.  You can play your own songs as well, but then other people couldn't hear them, and when you have the opportunity to alter the environment like that I don't know why you wouldn't choose to.

287,2004-03-19,Green Blackboards (And Other Anomalies),"
I'll go into it with much more specificity at a later date - maybe Monday - but Unreal Tournament 2004 is a great game and an almost ridiculous value.  It's only flaw isn't in code - it's in the human beings that feel like they have a license to say whatever they want because they bought the copy that includes a headset.  


No, today we're going to talk about Pandora Tomorrow.  I'm not supposed to talk about the single player portion, I guess.  All that does is make me want to, but I'm polite and I signed something.  I will say that it makes the original Splinter Cell look like a dry run.  


You might be curious to know how playing the new Pandora Tomorrow multi is like petting a cat.  Well, I'll tell you.  It is fun to pet cats, and cats certainly enjoy it, but mostly when you pet a cat you're doing it for yourself.  More than any other game I've played, and perhaps because of the very different roles involved, playing your best actually elevates the quality of the experience for your opponent.  You are almost working together, and in a strange way even collaborating on each round. 


It isn't like the raw competition you see in other online games - you can't compare it to CTF let's say, because each side in Pandora Tomorrow has such divergent goals and abilities.  What's more, getting your ass kicked over and over in CTF isn't enjoyable.  You each have the same equipment, so when they win it's like they're hitting you over the head with it.  When your opponent wins in this game, it's because they embodied that side's unique traits better than you did.  The trick is that if you are playing as the Shadownet spies and your Argus mercenary opponents are constantly running around with their headlamps on, planting proximity mines, setting Spy Traps, and maybe catching you with a phosphorescent grenade so that you leave glowing footprints, they are refining the properties of your spy experience considerably.  Simply by playing the game the best they can, the nastiest, they are dramatically improving the feeling of high-stakes espionage.  The same is true when you play Argus.  If spies are sneaking around the way they should be, deactivating sensors and cameras with their pistol, tracking you around the facility with Spy Bullets, disorienting you with flashbangs or (God forbid) actually grabbing you from behind and whispering sweet nothings, they are making it a better game.  


As the Spy, you want to feel like you are in a dangerous game where one false move will lay you low.  As the mercenary, you want competent prey that will test the strength of your defenses.  And you never feel more like your side when you're hiding behind a van in a parkade as the headlamp swings by you, or when you take one more look out the window and see your Shadownet opponent hanging from one hand from a ledge outside, pistol pointed into the room in an orchestrated moment of Woovian bliss.               


Like any other person who considers themselves hard-core, I initially found the four player limit the game imposes to be somewhat antique and unimaginative.  I can remember playing on servers for the original Tribes almost five years ago that supported a hundred and twenty-eight players - four is undeniably less.   It's only because I've played on the order of thirty rounds or so that I have a sense of what they they're getting at.  I've actually had friendly fire kills on the Mercenary side because the tension was so great that I shot at anything that moved on Motion Tracking mode.    


(Wait a second - have I talked about the Mercenary vision modes?  Let's get that out of the way.  Spies have the modes you associate with Splinter Cell already - night vision, and thermal.  Thermal is extremely useful in this game, as many levels have been created with its use in mind - Shadownets up above the ceiling looking down at mercenaries and tracking their movements as they go room to room.  Mercs aren't without their own tricks, though - hitting left on the d-pad activates Motion Tracking, which casts the entire screen in red - except for objects moving at a certain rate of speed.  In this way, you can observe an entire courtyard and immediately pick out the Spy if they should be foolish enough to make a break for it.  The reason I made a point of mentioning ""a certain rate of speed"" is that even if you are in motion tracking, a determined spy can sneak right up to you - right in front of your face - and remain invisible in that mode.  Or, another example.  I was deactivating a machine, I can't say what kind, but I was deactivating it good and proper.  A Mercenary walked right up by me and then proceeded to sort of hang out.  I wasn't sure if we were friends now, if he was just shy, I had no idea.  It turns out that the motion of deactivating it was so slight that it did not register on his visor.  He got wise just before I completed it though, and when I saw the headlamp come on I braced for the three round burst.  


The other advanced vision mode, Electromagnetic, casts everything in a light blue haze except for those items which produce electromagnetic fields.  So, televisions, pop machines, light fixtures, and even spies using their visors are plainly visible - in some cases, even through walls.  Remember the spy I mentioned, the one looking down through the ceiling on thermal?  I see him too, in this mode.  Spies can always ""go dark"" and shut down vision modes to avoid this, but they often need those modes to get around in the places they sneak through.  Mercs also get the headlamp I mentioned, in addition to a kind of laser rangefinder that can be swept through dark areas to find prey.  Okay, segue over.)


As I was saying, we were so flipped out by the combination of the huge, dark Subway section and the sounds of whistling wind and creaking iron that we actually shot each other in fear.  If everywhere you looked there was a spy, the proceedings would immediately devolve into a sort of high-tech bop-a-mole.  It needs to be important when you see the opposition, and in order for it to be important it can't be ubiquitous.  What's more, since it's four people tops, there should be tons of games out there - you might never have to play it with strangers if you don't want to.

If this is World of Warcraft in its beta form, then we would do well to fear the hybrid super heroin they will ultimately  unleash.  My propensity for ""crafting,"" if indeed that is an accurate term to describe clicking a button until some imaginary quantity is created, is well known - and this was before I was scanning the countryside in the style of Aragorn, selecting roots of a curative nature and making potions of various kinds while Gabriel was savagely mistreated by bears.       



Poring through celestial charts to determine the portents, muttering darkly over an altar slick with blood you might be tempted to think that it is World of Warcraft's purpose on this Earth to sanctify the MMOG genre, scouring it of the abusive, evil games which currently occupy the space.  The irony is that it is merely excellent, which may not alight on the high perch people have imagined for it. 


The word which constantly comes to my mind when considering the game is ""humane.""  I have quite a lot of patience for games of this type, I don't mind going to a town and asking every medieval jackhole I see where I can find the cathedral.  Gabe's not going to do that.  That sort of thing isn't fun for most people.  Gabe's going to cancel his account when he finds out that it takes twice the experience to get from this level to this level, or the materials you worked so hard to get are destroyed because of some arbitrary roll.  For you and me, hey, maybe we don't mind that kind of thing.  Maybe we hate ourselves already and see the genre as a way to work off spiritual debt, like a karmic gym.  Regular people, a definition I don't usually apply to Gabe, but whatever - regular people know that things like that are bullshit.  So why do we consent to them?  What's more, why do developers assail us with these notions?  Part of it is, I think, a twisted sense of tradition - the games before did it.  Part of it is that is keeps a person - a certain kind of person, at least - onboard for more suffering.  Maybe there's some kind of grind in the upper levels I haven't reached yet.  Maybe at level 30, you start losing experience when you die or some other antique convention of the genre.  I doubt it. 


In terms of raw polygonal power, the technology behind World of Warcraft does nothing to eradicate the state of the art - where the game excels is in the way it marshals those polygons toward realizing the world.  I was never one of the lucky Alpha players, so the only time I see Orcish architecture is from the back of a gryphon - they're testing the Alliance races at this point, think Gnomes, Dwarves, Night Elves and Humans.  Looking up from the road at the Dwarven city of Ironforge, you will be hard pressed to find fault in the view.  You can also see the tasteful (but hardly overpowering) details that light brings out of the environments, bringing the the stone surfaces in the foothills there into relief.  That area, called Dun Morogh, has details in the surface of the snow and stone roads that also take on this accent.  Now I'm getting wistful.  It is my opinion that they are specifically trying to do more with less, and with an art department is this strong they can make it work.  Buildings have an exaggerated, broadly drawn shape that evokes the sense of the whole building.  Also, with some chugging in huge towns or gryphon rides, you can play the game on a one gigahertz machine with a GeForce 2.  I mean really play it, not watch a slideshow entitled My Visit To Azeroth.  


I'm going to keep writing about this some more, this is just what is here now.  I played the game about thirty straight hours and I'm still decompressing the experience.

",Tycho Brahe,,https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/22/
289,2004-03-23,WoW,"
Every event today conspired against my writing this, except the one thing I wanted to do, which is play World of Warcraft.  My knowledge of the game world and its systems is not in any way encyclopedic - I was not in the Alpha, for example, so my character only has the experience and abilities I have been able to accrue since Friday's beta announcement.  However, it stands to reason that I might know some things that would interest you.    


For example, I know that the user interface is clean and sensible, everything in its place, nothing cluttered.  Somebody asked me about the usability of said interface, and I reminded them that the game was from Blizzard.  Don't be quick to discard that as some sort of fanboy bullet point.  The layout is professional, the menus are precise and direct without being didactic.  If you click on some item in your inventory, the slot it is supposed to go into lights up on your character sheet, that kind of thing.  Crafting menus are a great example of interface clarity, very similar from discipline to discipline, and as I have tried to communicate this is a screen I see a lot of.  Brother Farwall is a Paladin, that's true enough, but like Cadfael he can produce all manner of tinctures, unguents, and elixirs from common and uncommon herbs.  Please bring up the crafting interface in another window, I'm going to refer to it but I don't want to put it in-line.  We have enough trouble keeping things moving around here when I don't throw another fifty kilobytes into the page.


You can see at the top all the things I'm able to make - these are recipes that I purchased from an Alchemy trainer in one of the cities.  I should say ""mostly purchased,"" perhaps, because one of them - Minor Agility - is one I got from kicking this bear-man shaman motherfucker in his eldritch ass.  As soon as I could learn the recipe, I did.  Afterward, either because my skill increased or I'd learned something new, the gnarled Thornroot I collected began to also give me something called Swiftthistle.  So, here's a potion that I'd never heard of before, that uses a reagent I wasn't familiar with, and once I improved as an herbalist I began to recognize that it grew with another herb.  I'm made aware of these helpful plants by my Find Herbs skill - though such things exist there in the landscape for you to see with the naked eye, it can be helpful to have them highlighted within a certain radius.


You can also see what items I need to make the potions, and how many I currently have.  I'm almost out of the herbs I need to make the really cool stuff, but if you have what it takes to make something you see a number right there that indicates how many potions you have the ingredients for.  The color of each potion's name represents the difficulty of producing it, though I need to be clear - it is impossible to fail when crafting an item.  You do not fail, ever.  You might not succeed when gathering materials in the wild, but you're welcome to try again until you get it.  Difficulty simply determines the chance of your skill improving in a certain discipline, which itself  determines what recipes are available at the shop, or what herbs you can gather from the gameworld.  Imagine if you were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and in the process destroyed an entire loaf of bread and somehow the peanut butter got on your face.  That is how crafting works in other games. 


I push and process so much herb it's only a matter of time until the DEA brings the hammer down.  You don't have to wonder whether or not the work of my hands is popular with the party - though I can invoke the power of the Light to raise them from the dead, I certainly prefer my potions to do the work of keeping them from that state to begin with.  Paladins are decent healers, they'll do in a pinch, but the ability to crack out these one shot potions really expands my role in that regard.  I get them in trade for things other people in the crew make - Pork is handy with a hammer and anvil, and virtually everything I wear is made from the ore he finds with his mineral detection ability.  He's also able to make ""sharpening stones"" or ""weightstones,"" single use items that impart a temporary damage bonus to any weapon.   Gabe skins virtually every animal we put down, creating one-time use kits that improve any piece of armor permanently.  Those same beasts also produce lean cuts of meat, which Kara is able to cook (using cooking) on a fire (which he made with her Survival skill).  As an added bonus, sitting around the fire she made to cook things cuts down our downtime between fights, as it increases our Spirit which improves regeneration rates.         


Food and drink plays an important role in minimizing downtime.  There really isn't that much of it anyhow, but what there is can be shaved away by eating and drinking.  Just by sitting down and having a snack, player's health and mana regeneration rates skyrocket.  If you have a healer on top of that, I mean, there won't even be time to build the fire I was talking about.  You're already fighting monsters and having fun again.    


Often when you are fighting said monsters, you will also have some larger purpose as well.  You might have heard that the game is Quest focused, which is true to an extent - there are often many quests in a given area that are easy to find, because a gigantic exclamation point appears over a person's head.  Is the exclamation point silver?  That means they will have a quest for you when you are at a higher level.  Perhaps they have a question mark over their head - this means they're either the object of your quest, or you need to report back to them.  In addition to any experience you get from killing the monsters on these sojourns, you will get a bundle of XP - sometimes, a very significant bundle - in addition to cash money money, and sometimes even your choice of item.  When you start out, there are many quests right there that will start to introduce you first to the local area and then to the larger world, ultimately leading you to your capital city.  Some of these quests feel valid and communicate things about the region and the people in it, expanding what we know about Warcraft.  Some of these quests, eh, maybe not so fun.  There is a series near the Night Elven city of Auberdine that deal with devices called ""Buzzboxes"" which are the worst sort of ""kill these monsters, maybe they'll drop what you need, and then bring a whole bunch of these things somewhere else"" drudgery.  It's a crime the entire genre commits.  At least in WoW you're rewarded with a ton of experience and a truly awesome bag.        


This is part of what I meant by humane.  Yeah, we made you do sort of a boring quest, but Merry Christmas, here is the Experience Santa with a level for you.  You worked to get together all the stuff, you have enough skill to make it, so you can make it without failure.  Here's lots of food and drinks everywhere so you can actually play the game and not sit there fucking off for ten minutes or more.  Dying in these games sucks already, you have to run back to all the friends you just let down and explain why, in addition to the XP hit or whatever else.  In World of Warcraft, you run back to your body as a ghost - invisible to monsters,  and running at a greater speed.  In addition, you don't bind to a particular point - whatever lifestone equivalent is closest, that's where you spawn in.  If you don't want to run back to your corpse - or you haven't been raised by a party member or some polite stranger - then you need to pay some XP.  After the kindness they've shown in other areas, that's something I can make my peace with.    


I have to say, I really miss Final Fantasy XI's auction system.  I also miss the chocobos, but that's neither here nor there.  The ability to simply place an item up for sale at a given price and let the magic of that ethereal free market turn your garbage into money is even now giving an Econ major an erection.  Star Wars Galaxies, despite anything else people might say about it, has a pretty hot auction system as well.  Seeing people in World of Warcraft yapping in a public channel about their refuse seems archaic by comparison, because it is.  It's like a sports car that uses bicycle pedals for locomotion.  I heard there might be a more advanced system coming to bear in the future, and I guess I'd just like to put in a vote for that.

We had hit up the View Askew site - partially because Kevin Smith is our lord and savior, but also because we were curious to see what information there was about the film Jersey Girl.  The movie in question apparently wasn't made for critics, which struck us as a rock-solid strategem.  This culminated in the direct application of that principle to our own work, which produced something very much like what we would have done anyway.  It may be impolite, but the weight of a perfect stranger's sour opinion on our work is approximately nothing.          


Apparently Kevin Smith has sold out though, claims the chorus, for producing a film which does not refer to oral sex.  The movie may be bad for any number of reasons, I honestly don't know - like many other people I have not seen it.  I don't know that I ever need to.  However, I'm not sure what selling out has to do with anything.  I have a feeling that Kevin Smith pretty much does whatever the fuck Kevin Smith wants to do.  Maybe you haven't seen Jay And Silent Fucking Bob Strike Back, where he and his friends just kind of fucked around while the cameras rolled.  Oh yeah, he's a part of the fucking machine.  


I have a feeling he's getting older and that he would like to make a different kind of movie than he has typically done.  Yet it falls upon people who don't know the man to determine his secret heart via their infallible methods of detection and find him wanting.   


We receive the same stern appraisals, which always grips me with consternation.  I honestly don't know what selling out is supposed to mean anymore, the term is leveled with such regularity.  I was under the impression that it meant that your principles were for sale, that an indeterminate sum had changed hands and now you were under command.  You can actually be a completely independent webcomic and not pass muster.  Now it appears to involve infractions of some impossibly austere, orthodox hipster code, complete with constant play-by-play analysis by psychic forum trolls and betrayed fans who gleefully plot the coordinates of your downward trajectory.      


Switching gears, I wrote a short poem about Scott Kurtz being eaten by a crocodile, entitled ""Someone Please Help, Scott Kurtz Is Being Eaten By A Crocodile.""  


""It hurts,"" thought Kurtz, while being chewed
""It is, of course, considered rude
To speak while one is eating, but
Mightn't one speak, when they are food?""

I'm punch-drunk, stupid, and stumbling from a succession of punishing blows, strikes administered with precision by a weekend solid with electronic amusements.  It's true that our incorporation into the World of Warcraft beta - which we've now learned will likely gestate beyond the five month period - has created new tensions inside our Inbox.  The usual dark themes make an appearance:  our deep collusion with Blizzard, the result of having been anointed with evil oils of nebulous manufacture, has done this or that and now we are incapable of providing genuine coverage of the game.  I suppose that given the opportunity, they would turn down a beta spot based on some heretofore unuttered moral code.  What I should do at any given moment has always been shrouded is mystery, I do so enjoy these communiques from ethical paragons.   


There is a corollary to what Scott Kurtz calls in his strip ""DVD Adultery"" that pertains specifically to the nexus created by your special lady and videogames, and it is one that I must contend with second hand.  Outside of a brief but torrid dalliance with The Sims, my own wife has little use or affection for the passtime this site is dedicated to.  On the other hand, Kara is actually a rather stalwart acolyte of our order, her Night Elf priestess frequently dropping the boom on fools.  But with her visit home last week - on a sort of tour to promote her production of a human life - word came down that Gabe was not to play his character during her absence.  She didn't want to be relegated to sidekick status level-wise, which is something I understand.  However, utilizing a loophole in the edict, Gabe decided to switch characters while she was gone and actually found a class he was better suited to.


Humans were curious about how combat works in WoW, but I'm afraid that there are no grand revelations to make regarding that facet of the game.  As is expected in the genre, you select an opponent and then attacks occur at regular intervals.  There's a duration between attacks that is clearly labeled on the weapon - my oak mallet for example, a fairly ponderous device, clocks in at 3.5 seconds.  I don't hit as often as someone using most swords, but the odds are good that when I hit you with this thing you will remember it.  There are also abilities which occur instantly, i.e., outside of the normal attack continuum.  In this way, you can react to situations in real time - for example, using them to cancel an enemy caster's spell.  


In addition to this, there are obviously many class specific abilities you may learn and upgrade as you progress through levels.  Something I thought was interesting about Warriors was their ""stances,"" explicit modes of combat with their own unique skills.  If you'll be handling the tank role, for example, switching to a defensive posture will increase your defense - that much is probably clear - and also offer a suite of abilities which reflect that role.  For example, a shield bash technique which interrupts casting or a mode that increases your chance to block a single hit for five or so seconds.  The Battle Stance is also full of tricks, tricks which can snip your tendons like Hamstring or deal damage over time like Rend.  If you're curious about other techniques, by all means read the list they have on the site.  Each stance actually has its own toolbar at the bottom of the screen, which helps keep your abilities of each type straight.  This is the class Gabe was working before, and he dispensed some genuine harm in that role.


What made him begin consorting with demons isn't exactly clear, but for his new class he chose Warlock.  It's what is often called a ""Pet"" class, one whose summoned or constructed creatures are a main focus.  When he summons a demon, and it's made clear that the Imp he draws to him does not enjoy it, the creature sticks around and does your bidding.  After gaining ten levels, Gabe was able to take a quest from a master warlock in exchange for the ability to summon a Voidwalker - a sort of djinni made of blue shadow which sports golden armbands.  Each of these pets has advantages and disadvantages, the Imp is a caster and the Voidwalker is more of a bodyguard, but you understand the idea.  Each of these summoned creatures gets their own toolbar above your own to make manipulating them a simple procedure.  Gabe enjoys playing a strategic role with these pets more than he enjoyed standing in front of Kara and getting punched in the face, so I'm assuming that the punched in the face role now falls to me.  Looking forward to some of that.  


I also snapped a couple shots you might enjoy, who knows.  I found Lakeshire to be quite a sight from the bridge over Lake Everstill, and thought you might share the sentiment - then, this morning, I grabbed another shot from a different time of day that I thought might help place the other one in context.

I had no idea revolting continuity would emerge from the last strip, but continuity makes a shrewd opponent.  We found ourselves so curious about Brian, however, that we simply wanted more.  When you see his mismatched furs in the moonlight, his strangled expression, and this is to say nothing of his vicious bear, you may find yourself craving him as well.


Despite some comics you may have seen online, Gabriel and I are not gay and we rarely have sex with one another.  Indeed, long ago we solicited the services of two young women for this exact purpose and eventually went about securing them in exclusive contracts.  I chose the Brenna model and have thus far been reasonably satisfied with the purchase.  There's only one facet of the union that grinds, and that is her acquisition of a nicotine addiction.  She doesn't chew, I never retract from intimacy with any kind of mulch on my face.  She smokes.  I don't care if you smoke, as the odds are good I never have to taste the inside of your mouth.  


It's a ""hobby"" she picked up during one of her bacchanalian summer drama tours.  I asked her if it was accurate to say that she started doing it because the cool kids were, and she replied that, no, it was because everyone else was doing it.  Apparently there are points of distinction between those two things that my apparatus doesn't have the magnification to detect.  For a long time, I only suspected it - when I would kiss her during some college visit, it would taste as though she had been eating cats still crisp from a barn fire.    


She has tried to quit before, but she clearly didn't mean it and I had no energy to support her in some grueling ordeal she had only nominal interest in.  This worked out great for her, because then when she failed it could be my fault.  It's a service that I provide people too lazy to take the reins of their own lives.  


This time, though, I get the impression that she's very serious.  Furrowed, Gary Kasparov brow serious.  And so, at her request, I installed The Sims and Living Large so she would have something to do when urge, like a precision meteorite, strikes her entire body.  She has her own computer now, so it's not like before where I would approach softly, hat in hand, and ask to check my e-mail.  Thus far, it appears to be working.  She'll play for an hour before work, come home, and play until ten o'clock as she noisily pops Trident.  It occurs to me that if she thinks of gaming as a less addictive substance, she might be in for a grim revelation.  For example, I do what she is doing now, only I don't share the nicotine precursor.  I've been hooked on the shit since game systems came in wood-grain.

One of the questions humans frequently ask is ""when will the Fruit Fucker Two-Thousand return stateside,"" a question answered in the crossover with Elf Only Inn.

We attended some kind of fancy screening of Hellboy last night, which made me feel like something of a fraud because I've only recently become an enthusiast.  Luckily for me, there was not a trivia phase which would have subjected me to derision.  At any rate, the event was not unpleasant.  


When you have a friend who actually took Comics As Literature in college it does something in their minds, their minds you understand, it upsets that delicate machinery so that they become like as unto a combination salesman/missionary/mercenary.  They've got something you really need, they have a passion that either extends beyond or projects from the border of the known, but they're also hard bitten and they will hurt you if you don't start reading Powers by Brian Michael Bendis.  He's been pushing Hellboy forever, even before it was alphabetically valid to do so.  If you are as I am, you read the comics your friends tell you to, this is a comic a friend should have told you about already.  


For an interesting taste of the character, I would direct you to one that is actually online, entitled ""The Corpse.""  Now, this comic is hosted at Playboy's website, so odds are good you don't want this URL in your history.  Maybe this is one you read at home.  But it will show you how myth, facts, and history occupy equal stature in universe of the comic.

It concerns the collusion of Nazi Clockwork Assassins and Russian Wizards in an effort to puncture space and draw in sleeping, ancient Gods while the paranormal wing of the FBI, assisted by a demon child, does their best to thwart this procedure.

Today's strip concerning Div's ""peripherals"" really just scratches the surface.  


I can't tell you how often it happens that I'm wandering the streets of Stormwind, capitol of the Kingdom of Men, when someone will shout something very much like the following.




Why yes, yes I do know, Memnoch.  Follow me.  But let's take a step back first, so that everyone might know.   


First of all, I mean, you have to get to Stormwind - the last bastion of human civilization.  While some people use their feet for locomotion, and that's quaint, other people fly graceful lion/eagle hybrids and we do encourage that.




Pass through the main gate, and enter the Valley Of Heroes.




These statues honor warriors lost through the Dark Portal.  In the distance, you can see the spires of the Great Cathedral I visit every time I return here.  No enchanters here though, which means we're not finished yet.




Cross that bridge, taking note of the aerie where travellers land and leave on their flying mounts - in fact, it looks like someone is just arriving now.  Hang a left, and enter the inner gate.




This is the bustling Stormwind Trade District, just as the sun is beginning to set.  To the left, Pestle's Apothecary.  To the right, The Cheese Cutters.  I typically take the alley straight ahead past the cart, moving on to the Cathedral, but today I'm playing tour guide.  At the first intersection, take a left.       




Hopefully this picture and the last will give you an idea of how organic this city seems, even though it's as modern a place as you're likely to travel to.  The ground is not uniform in the slightest, though the ground is clearly cobbled which gives one the impression that years of horse and foot traffic have made it this way.  You and I are only going to see a very small portion of the city today, we won't be going to Old Town, the Dwarven District, or any number of other places.  It's completely overwhelming on your first visit.   


Take the next right, and then left through the tunnel.




It should open up right onto a bridge over the canals, and Memnoch's Enchanter Trainer is that cottage just to the right.  No sign or anything, nothing really enchanted about the building at all, which is why I'd imagine people have a hard time finding it.  It's just outside what's called the Mage Quarter, which is where you'd expect to find this kind of mystical crap.  I mean, look at this place. 




It's magical as all get-out.  It's possible that Enchanters simply aren't welcome in there.  Perhaps actual Wizards detest Enchanters in much the same way that an actual surgeon might revile the cast of a hospital drama, so this guy has to do his thing right outside it, like an eldritch scalper hawking vouchers for the supernatural.


In any event, there's your Enchanter Trainer - just outside the Mage Quarter, to your right.

The ersatz Reader Appreciation Month continues, apparently, with the return of 
href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/04/07"">Twisp and Catsby
.  I'm not 
exactly sure what happened, but at some point we must have realized that we have a penchant 
for creating characters that resonate with people and then promptly forgetting they exist.    


I have a suspicion that the 
href=""http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/everquest2/preview_6092895.html"">recent Everquest 2 
coverage
 is designed to staunch the flow of possible defection from their own monstrous 
timesink to a timesink of slightly more cunning 
manufacture.  It has never stopped being fashionable to ridicule Everquest, jokes of this 
kind are always well received - but I do respect the lineage.  It's been out for a long 
while, seen many expansions, and retained a large playerbase through the use of Pavlovian 
conditioning techniques.  It is a game so addictive that you will let your baby die while you 
work toward your next level.  There's just something pure about that.


I also have to wonder if these guys are seriously thinking about some of these screenshots 
before they release them.  God dammit publishers, we have offered time and time again to look 
at your screenshots and tell you if they are offensive in some way before you expose us to 
their toxins.  This would cost you a hundred thousand dollars if you went to a consultant, 
they'd look them over and then they'd tell you they were all great and hold open their palm 
for the money.  One company has taken us up on this offer, and saved themselves a world of 
grief.  When you put out a shot like this 
one, I just shake my head.  We gave id what they deserved with their flying jetpack head 
devils, but to that shot's credit it did not include any fantasy hermaphrodites.  Gamespot's 
quote beneath this shot is ""You're In Their World Now, And It Looks Fantastic.""  First, 
that's one of two times you directly quote the slogan of the company without irony.  I need 
you not to do that.  Second, no it doesn't.  Lest you think I'm being selective, here is the 
entire screenshot 
archive.  You've got a few shots that would have passed muster, and a few shots 
distributed like the red constellation of a herpes infection.  Gamespot might be referring to 
the spell effects, which aren't themselves offensive - but they certainly couldn't have been 
referring to the shot right over the quote.       


The issue with the shots isn't technical - this is an engine that flexes the juice in DirectX 
9 in ways that we don't often get to see.  A few nice landscapes and bump maps are plainly 
visible, one could think to themselves that this is something they could gaze upon without 
injury.  The issue is a grievous imagination deficit.  They look as though every original 
element has been painstakingly stripped away, until reaching some predetermined, inoffensive 
generic void.  On technical merits, the engine easily bests WoW.  There's no contest.  On 
vision, on the manifestation of artistic vision scale which I have just invented, you can't 
even see World of Warcraft from where they are.  World of Warcraft is in a harvest field 
wading through golden, chest-high wheat.  They are in a cold place shivering as they 
wait for a morning that never comes.

John Woo has optioned the rights to make a film based on Metroid, but that hardly means anything.  Someone optioned it before him as you'll recall, the gaming high council met to determine the our official response, and then the option was allowed to lapse.  Also, Woo's entire role in this movie still isn't clear.  But I'm crossing my fingers, I want to believe that Samus Aran can survive the translation to a screen of those dimensions, so hopefully whatever intellect takes note of gestures like that is paying attention.      


At any rate, for good or ill, the entire endeavor is Gabe's fault. 


There wasn't much friction caused by my post on those Everquest 2 shots, largely because looking at the screens proves my point.  Some people seemed to think I was comparing the gameplay of World of Warcraft and EQ2, which is something I'm completely not qualified to talk about.  Very few people are.  


My concern was primarily with how these ridiculous shots get into circulation to begin with.  There's a link I got from a reader that I've been pasting into every conversation about the game, and I might as well just put it in-line here.  If they had just grabbed screenshots of Everquest 2 in play, maybe the bump-mapped ocean swells or fantasy vision modes like ultravision, everyone would be saying ""holy shit"" instead of ""that looks like a person's shit.""  Take a look at these videos of the game over at The Safehouse.  If you told me that these movies and those screenshots were from the same game, I'd assume you were a liar.


It isn't often that I have an occasion to expound on it, but scrolling shooters have always been a passion of mine.  Raiden, UN Squadron, Silk Worm, more recently Ikaruga, that kind of thing.  I saw one mentioned on Insert Credit you can download for free called TUMIKI Fighters, and it's really the best sort of electronic morsel.  It's completely nuts.  As you destroy enemy ships - all of them made from elementary shapes, like your own craft - be sure to pick up the chunks as they descend.  They graft themselves onto your ship and emit dangerous geometric forms, which deployed in concert constitute a deadly lexicon.  Actually, this site appears to have tons of games of this kind, all by the same Japanese creator.


In the time between typing that last sentence and typing this one, I have downloaded and played all the games he has made available.  You might not get much done today if you go over there.  When I started playing them it was a reasonable human hour, and now that I've finished it's like three o'fucking clock.

Resident Evil: Outbreak is a revelation for PS2 owners.  That revelation is, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, ""Go Buy A Hard Disk.""  


It has come up before in posts, where I have a reservoir of patience compared to Gabe's decorative thimble-full, and it is this reservoir that allows me to access what I consider the higher order genres like Role-Playing or Tactical Strategy.  It's a simplification, but as a general rule it's accurate.  Another way to look at it is to say that I am simply more forgiving, more tolerant, and Gabriel sees boredom in a videogame - a device ostensibly designed to produce enjoyment - as a personal insult.  Outbreak has completely exhausted my supply.  Usually I will exhort him to give a game a bit more time, just a few more minutes, wasn't that a cool thing we just saw, but this time even I was like fuck it, I'm out of here.


Played online, Resident Evil: Outbreak is a game that accurately captures the feel of the series - not only that, the addition of more active participants substantially but reverently appends RE canon.  Helping a friend nearly overcome by the virus up off the ground so that you can continue running to safety is a sensation I recommend to all gamers.  The brief comfort afforded by a compatriot nailing boards across a doorway to staunch the zombie tide.  All these things are good.  And the special abilities afforded to each character - things like a backpack for storing items, medical training, lockpicking, or a toolkit - they help you make the best of a bad situation.  If you die, which in this game means succumbing to the virus, you become a zombie and may chew on your former associates.  Visually, I have to say that I give it high marks - textures are a little muddy, but there's a lot going on.  Maybe too much, actually.


It pains me to tell you that I would call the game in its current state unplayable without the hard drive - and even with it installed, the issue isn't entirely obviated.  I assumed that the lack of voice support would be the sticking point - it would have been appreciated, but that's not the dealbreaker.  Any tension created by the scenario is drained away by these ponderous level loads.  Depending on how curious you are about your surroundings, you will spend as much time loading as you do playing, and this is not an exaggeration.  Now that we're starting to see some truly compelling online content available for the Playstation, in the case of Final Fantasy XI it requires the hard disk and in the case of Resident Evil it might as well.  I honestly wonder what made them release it in this state.  What about the games I'm looking forward to for the PS2 online - Capcom's Monster Hunter, or the platform debut of Syphon Filter.  Is this the sort of performance we can expect?  So you buy a network adapter for forty dollars, screw that in, only to find that in order to be viable platform you need a hard disk as well?  If they keep securing shit-hot online content, that'll take some of the sting out - but even the most basic math skills will inform you that you've essentially just bought another console and then grafted it on to the old one.  


A few months ago, I received a really strange media kit from Microsoft.  The purpose of the kit was to remind news sites what a great platform Windows, specifically Windows XP, was for gaming.  I was never under the impression that there was a platform that actually competed with Windows - it's true that there are major releases that launch multiplatform, but I think of that as politeness on the part of developers and publishers as opposed to something that signifies genuine competition.   


When people started telling me that as a part of this campaign, a patch for Tron 2.0 had been released that only installed on Windows XP, certainly this was agitating - but since I had already beaten the game and rarely played in the online arenas it was asinine but didn't strike that close to home.  With this new one, the two bonus Onslaught maps for Unreal Tournament 2004, they really just look like a bunch of cocks.   


I appreciate that someone took the time to get those files out in a format anyone could download, but they shouldn't have needed to.  It's apparently not enough for Microsoft to hold unchecked dominion over personal computing, oh no - they also want to determine what kind of fork you use.  If there are genuine reasons to upgrade, then please - I'd like to know about them.  But actively breaking compatibility doesn't craft a compelling case.  In fact, it makes people believe all the things that get said about you.

Tycho has come down with a pretty nasty cold, so I told him to take the day off and get some rest. I'll be logging into WOW occasionally just to make sure the son of a bitch isn't power leveling all day. 


It's two in the morning and I just got back from a night of Splinter Cell:PT over at a friends house. He had four boxes on system link and it was an absolute blast. Like any multiplayer game it's about a million times more fun when you're playing it with friends rather than the fucking jackholes that seem to populate Xbox Live these days. Today's comic deals with one of the things I find most frustrating about playing SC:PT on Live. I can't even count the number of times I've seen players drop just seconds before they lose a ranked game. In the comic I suggest that death is the only acceptable punishment for this sort of behavior, but in reality I'm not quite so heartless. I think for instance that simply filling their lungs with angry wasps or replacing their blood with lye would be satisfactory. 

UbiSoft tried to deal with this problem by making players who drop lose points in the next full ranked round they compete in. That's one of the reasons you will often hear players complaining that they lost points even though they won. Chances are these players are good for nothing droppers. Of course understanding the scoring system in SC:PT requires an intimate knowledge of seven dimensional math. The complex equations required to calculate your score after a given match could fry the circuits of today's most powerful thinking-machine super computers.  I don't know all the variables the system takes into account, but from what I understand it starts off by calculating the exact age of God. 

I mentioned yesterday that the ""Gabe"" wallpaper had about a 1000 more downloads than the ""Tycho"" wallpaper. I felt pretty good about myself until I took a look back through our stats. It turns out that the Fruit Fucker Prime wallpaper had about 15,000 more downloads that either of us. It's pretty hard to compete with a skyscraper sized robot whose payload of pint sized fruit fuckers can violate an entire orchard in the space of a few minutes. 


I'll be back later today with more.

Reader Appreciation Month went on hiatus for a brief period, and for that we apologize.  We're back on track, though - here's a little Frank for your trouble.      


After another very long post about World of Warcraft, I am usually directed by readers to mention Lineage 2 or City of Heroes.  I'm not morally opposed to it or anything, but the largest reason why I discuss WoW and not these other games is that I'm actually in the beta - there's a possibility I could tell you something that wasn't available from another source.  I didn't apply for either of the other betas not because I'm convinced the people developing them are evil, though I'm open to the possibility.  I just don't know how many games in this genre you could actually play simultaneously.  That's why the SOE All Access Pass always struck me as odd.  It would be like renting four houses on the same block and trying to live in all of them.        


That's all well and good, but I'm susceptible to suggestion - so when a few hundred people tell me to do something it's indistinguishable from my own will.  In the case of Lineage 2, I was able to snag an extra beta code from a reader, and in the case of City of Heroes I have a group of friends completely addicted to it.  If you should stumble upon DocBot3000 in some crime infested alley, remind him that he has a physical body which can be used to fucking call me.     


Let me tell you about my first two play sessions in Lineage 2, the sequel to the most populous Massive game in the world.  To provide a bit of dark foreshadowing, they were also my last two play sessions of Lineage 2.  They were the last two times I will play the game ever.  


Session One:  After downloading the free client and creating an account, I am killed in a nondescript field by what I think was a baby fox.


Session Two:  After creating an Orc character, I spawned into the starter area and saw three spinning heads that circled a geyser of mystical flame.  A player all in black rushed at me low, an odd anime caricature, and killed me before I could close the tutorial dialogue.  Incredible. 


It was player behavior surrounding the original Lineage that led to many of the strange tales we used to hear about Korean Internet cafes - the Real World Player Killing, where some guys from a rival kingdom in would find you in the real world and then beat the shit out of you.  Being struck repeatedly by strangers sounds preferable to playing it at this point.  I try to be good to the humans that visit Penny Arcade, I brave new code and relate my experiences in these little broadcasts.  But I love myself more than this.  It looks great.  I'm sure there are people for whom Lineage 2 will represent the cat's pajamas, the apex of feline sleepwear.  They can have the clock cycles the server would have used simulating my demise at the paw of of some baby animal or cunning player killer.       


City of Heroes is, from the reports I receive, a Massively Multiplayer game minus the bullshit.  There's really no inventory to speak of.  You create heroes by combining origins and archetypes, putting to use the most advanced, most complete character creation mechanism yet.  You can even register as a Supergroup with your friends, wearing a team color scheme while you're scouring the city.  Then, you go kill guys.  There's a lot I don't know about it, which is why I'm going to ship you over to Absath at Ctrl-Alt-Del to read his write-up.  I certainly support expanding the range of settings for Massive games beyond Fantasy and Science Fiction, but not being able to play a villain of any kind is what kept me from applying to this beta.  The setting has some very nice touches, and I find their original villains amusing - but I'm mentioning it at the behest of readers, not because I stay up all night thinking about the game. 


I should probably mention that we will be attending this week's Sakuracon event, which goes from April 23rd to April 25th.  What started out as terror last time eventually morphed into fascination, and I do not doubt this year's experience will describe a similar arc.

306,2004-04-21,He Could Have Been Nicer To Those Babies,"
Frankly, we're worried about the Live assholes, but we're confident they'll find some way to make people's lives miserable wherever they go.      


If you play Splinter Cell on Live, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Finding a good couple of guys to play with is like finding a pearl in your Captain Crunch.  It's fucking rare.  Once you do find these mythical opponents, there are long pauses between rounds so that ""J. R. R. Tokin'"" can maintain his state of mind.  Nine times out of ten, not an exaggeration, your enemies will disconnect before the game is even over - let alone before each team gets a chance to play both sides, which again almost never happens.  For pure chicanery and/or mischief, your average Live player ranks very near Leprechauns.  


My friend (and virtuous foe of evil) the DocBot3000 came by on Monday and showed me the ropes in City of Heroes, and it is a hell of a lot better than I knew.  Screenshots didn't do much for me, filled as they were with other people's heroes, and like many others I was interested in creating villains with underworld cartels as opposed to righteous servants of justice.  I had seen a very good number of banal characters produced with the much touted character creation tools, but let me make clear that you can get out what you put into that thing.  The likelihood is very high that the do-gooder in your mind's eye can be coaxed into existence.    


Screenshots also don't communicate the animations and special effects, and believe me when I say that in a game where a single screen can hold a hundred superheroes one does tend to see an effect or two.  You'll also see, though it might depend on your machine, tons of ambient characters crossing plazas and filling sidewalks - presumably, these are the consumers of your heroism.  The city is broken up into different neighborhoods with their own feel, and while running, flying, or floating to your next mission you might see some young punks trying to cut an old lady.  These essentially amount to random encounters you can take or not take, though looking on while someone's grandmother is brutalized isn't particularly heroic.  They can reward you with ""influence"" which is called ""money"" in any other game.  


After creating a character that combines the Natural origin with the Blaster archetype - essentially, a gun expert a la The Punisher - I ran my character Imprimatur through their perfectly sensible tutorial section.  It was here I found that the crime infested buildings in the game represent instanced dungeons - that is to say, upon entering one alone or in a group, a ""shard"" of it is spun off for your exclusive use.  You never see higher level heroes in there camping the Kingpin or his carefully distinguished equivalent.  As you fight and defeat jackholes, if an enemy has a powerup - either an ""Inspiration,"" the equivalent of a temporary stat increase, or an ""Enhancement,"" which can improve your powers in any number of ways - there is no need to go pick it up off the body.  That's right, no kneeling down, no stopping or waiting.  This game is absolutely, completely, and entirely about kicking guys, or frying them, or controlling their minds or whatever.  If something gets in the way of that, I have a feeling that the developer did everything they could to remove it.  


Which is, oddly, where my problem comes in.  I wouldn't say that the game lacks depth, as laying your enemies low is the thrust of virtually every MMO, and indeed most videogames.  No, it is almost as though the game lacks width.  Compared to other games of the genre, outside of conflict with enemies there isn't anything to do.  I mean it, there's nothing.  Some people write in and they say that's perfectly fine with them, and others - perhaps ones that have spent a fair amount of time in other Massive worlds - come away expecting other in-game activities like crafting or canasta.  Certainly, though, if jolting thugs with your arm cannon strikes you as a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon, you might want to leave one free.  There is an endless supply of criminals so stupid as to commit crimes in broad daylight, in a city with seven superheroes per square foot, all for a purse that contains some gum and a bottle of multivitamins the label takes great pains to establish are only appropriate for senior citizens.

The same World of Warcraft update that bolted on the tyrannical Rest System also did something else, namely, add all the Horde races as playable characters.  It also added the Druid class, available to Night Elves and Tauren, which is exceedingly fresh and allows transformation into bears, cats, and some kind of fucked up looking seal thing.  Anyway, that's not the point.  The point is that the new Undead race broaches etiquette questions that can literally pierce the mind.


I've just obtained the new Hitman game, which is not called Hitman 3 but rather Hitman: Contracts, and I can vouch for the gripping introduction.  Staying here all weekend with a bottle of Tamnavulin 12 Year and Hitman resident in memory sounds pretty good to me, but it is not to be. Today and all weekend I will be exposing myself to those odors which are unique to human beings for whom bathing is an annual event, like a holiday.  


The Sakuracon provides an ego regulation service that has become increasingly necessary as the site has grown.  I will admit to you that I sometimes feel like a bad-ass, which is patently insane.  What do I do, really.  I ramble to people I don't know with a familiarity I haven't earned.  I need events like this one, ones where we are absolutely incidental to the culture, to take me down a couple pegs.  Yesterday I sat in the foyer, hunched forward, musing about how presumptive it is for me to bring merchandise to something like this.  When my blood began to feel viscous I knew that the Sakuracon was engaged in its holy work.          


These events are about Fred Gallagher, also known as Piro.  He writes and draws Megatokyo, which is a phenomenal success and tuned with precision to the cravings of the Japanese culture enthusiast.  I'm not saying that he has invented a machine to snare those people, anymore than we are able to attract those who play games.  I think he likes this stuff and it comes out.  I used to maintain a fire in my heart about the split between him and Largo, his old partner on the site, and I had manufactured a Piro persona I could loathe readily.  When you meet the guy, it's really, really hard to hate him.  Believe me, I'm good at hating.  I've got a degree in that shit.  But he seems to detest himself in actuality.  


For a long time I thought of this as a construct, emblematic of a deep cynicism and cleverness.  This may have been projection.  At any rate, I can tell you that it's quite genuine.  Please do not stop your forum threads about how his site has gone downhill - those will always provide me succor as his erstwhile competitor - but do not doubt for a moment that his artistic paralysis represents a genuine malady.  His body language communicates an encyclopedia of vicious self-assessments.  He can't maintain eye contact.  He looks away, as though the faces of other people somehow constitute a bright light.    


So, I'm going over where he is today to receive my adjustment.  Perhaps I will see you there.  


Oh, and one more thing:  we know that the post Old Man Murray world can be scary sometimes.  It can be hard to know where to turn when content from Erik appears mysteriously on random web pages like supernatural phenomena.  The True Meaning Of Life on the other hand, as Old Man Murray's hideous doppelganger, provides surreal hostility in a manner that is somewhat more dependable than actively scouring the entire Internet.

I'm at the con goofing around on a borrowed laptop, and I saw some things that might interest you.


Hitting up Evil Avatar, I saw that NCSoft would be showing off City of Villains at E3 - that's right, City of Villains.  The brief note at Gamespot mentions something about building your evil organization, which seems to imply a somewhat different gameplay experience.  I guess we'll know in a couple weeks. 


Some readers felt that I gave City of Heroes short shrift when I discussed it before, because I did not mention the rich story arcs that will surely exist in the retail version.  Presumably they were talking about special events like the one they closed out the beta with - where alien beings descended in great ships from space.  Saw that one on Evil Avatar, too.  I'm all for special events, and goodness knows I'm even into stories.  However, I'm also into playing games and I call them like I see them.


That Gamespot article also mentioned another NCSoft game to be shown at E3, the NetDevil developed Auto Assault, which sounds like a Car Wars-y Massive vehicle battle thing.  Game like that's been along time comin'.

""Monday's comic might be kind of mean, Fred - I'm just letting you know,"" I said.  He laughed and told me that was fine.  He hadn't seen it, though.


What a change in that guy.  What I said on Friday hasn't ceased being true, but it's true such a small percentage of the time that it's worth making a point of it.  What the painfully shy or socially awkward among our number would be comforted to know is that interpersonal skills can improve through use to a startling degree.  I know it's no comfort right away - there's fear associated with managing the variables in any conversation.  It is as though I told you that the more you tame lions, the less likely you are to be devoured.  But there is a type of ""muscle"" involved whose function can be improved through use, and I think that Piro's backbreaking con schedule has shaped him into a person quite capable of the work that comes with this strange territory.      


A fair number of people came by expressly to soothe us, which was appreciated - but I think we're over the hump as far as Anime Con discomfort goes.  Last year, I believe I said I felt like an invading force, a splinter or somesuch.  There were some this year that went out of their way to make me feel like that.  I felt more like an Ambassador this time around, from some imaginary place concerned primarily with gaming, like our booth was a kind of embassy for expatriates to confess their sins against the motherland.


I'm often asked to come to this room or that room at the conventions I attend, but I usually don't have the opportunity.  This year, I made it my focus.  It turns out that one can construct quite the efficacious Tycho trap with only a few cups and some Parrot Bay rum.    


The first place I went was a fairly small affair, incorporating humans to which I felt an immediate kinship.  Certainly our extended discussion of those wonders unique to Silent Hill 2 amplified my already warm affection.  The next party revolved (for me) largely around Wario Ware for the Cube, whose ability to turn the party out far surpasses the impression I was given from reviews.  Indeed, with a funk index of 143, one could bump their ride simply by placing the disc on the hood. 


A girl came by on Saturday, dressed as what she called ""Haku"" from ""Naruto.""  She had what looked like battle wounds on her forearms which struck me as very convincing.  When she came by the next day, though, out of costume, she had raised red welts where the wounds had been - they were worse, and even open in places.  ""Things are kind of bad at home,"" she said.


The convention made me think about how different the sacraments are in gaming and anime culture.  Certainly, we can sit together and watch something - I know for a fact that every showing of Red Vs Blue is packed, and those who emerge speak incredulously of Pumas.  But actually enjoying our thing itself is often either absolutely solitary or occurs in small, tight-knit groups.  Even at a LAN, I'm glad to have the company, and certainly upraised hands are convenient for high-fiving.  But there is a far-away place that exists from round to round that is so distant from humanity in real terms that I would be afraid to specify how remote it actually is.


As I looked out in the dark at the ""Rave"" on Saturday night, I tried to picture the ""Rave"" at GenCon or some other gaming convention and it just wasn't happening.  I hold a tiny rave in my heart each time I score critical damage, and that's about it.

I was just telling Gabriel that this strip would be an excellent opportunity to use the word ""urethra,"" and I was dead right.  Many of the strips in the Penny Arcade canon did, in their original iterations, include some reference to this private canal which was subsequently redacted by my cohort.    


Let's touch on this Jump To Lightspeed thing for a moment.  Gamespy happens to have the best information I can find, so this link goes to them - you'll want to read that, and then come back.  


We have deserved a sequel to X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter for some time, one which employs your ""modern technology"" to flex the Star Wars universe, and it would appear that it is (in fact) being produced - but in a form that you might not expect.  It is being released as an expansion to Sony slash Lucasarts' Massive Role-Playing game, a product which people feel varying ways about.  The things I hear about it mostly lead me to believe that investing my time in games other than Star Wars Galaxies hasn't done me wrong. 


One really does get the impression that this new game experience is somewhat bolted on to the existing framework.  Certainly, the ability of players to become shipwrights and produce machines which sail into deep space is utterly invigorating - but will the gameplay that occurs in those far reaches appeal to those same people?  We now know that there are missions which will have flight as well as terrestrial components, but is a person into the game mostly for the space combat going to level a character strictly to ramble around on backwater worlds?   


I don't know that this is the game people want - particularly where a monthly fee is concerned.  On the other hand, I can see a well tuned, internally consistent product which just focuses on the regions between worlds as being an excellent setting for a completely new Massive game, one without the original Star Wars Galaxies fixed like a weight around its neck.  Complete unto itself, it combines the best of Freelancer's mission-based, action oriented gameplay with Eve Online's rich fabrication, corporations, and player-built stations.  I think we can both agree that skirmishes will erupt over mineral rich asteroids in zones dedicated to consensual PvP, and that the expanded universe details spacefaring races that have earned their place in the sun.  Now, if they want to give a person who already plays Galaxies a leg up in this new game, you know, whatever - do it.  Give them some molybdenum Ching-Chong to weld onto their chassis.  But for the love of God, don't make me install that thing.  I'll pay your fifteen dollars a month, but not for the game you've announced.  I'd pay it for the game you're hinting at, but would never produce.

The bear issue notwithstanding, her fixation on the outside world is shrouded in mystery.  While it is incontrovertible that The Night-time Is The Right Time, I submit that it is the right time for absolute translation into a Massive role-playing game and not the right time to have one's foot pierced by a discarded hypodermic needle in a public park.    


The first three years of the site, I read and responded to every mail I received.  When unsolicited mail began to become a major factor in my correspondence I was initially able to hold on, culling certain words with filters for example.  When the viruses began to hit, the viruses that harvest e-mails from files sitting in your temporary browser directories, I declared that Spam had essentially won and that human dialogue had been crushed.  My addy is more than five years old, at this point.  It is no longer simply ""low hanging fruit"" for crawlers to snatch and return to the Spam Lords, is is the very address they use to christen a new bulk-mailing.  I gave up, and I am very sorry if we were discussing something very interesting two years ago when then I winked out of existence.     


I have had an on again, off again relationship with this method of communication ever since.  The reality is that it takes six or seven hours of constant typing to mail everyone back, and if I'm not going to mail everyone back then I don't see the point of doing it.  It creates a situation where I will give up the best part of each day in order to correspond with a person who clearly hates me, or to corral the mails from some new virus with potent RegEx jiujitsu.  I don't mind the jiujitsu portion, but handling this shit manual wasn't working anymore and it was starting to electrocute my mind.


The thing that broke me was these new spams that just combine random odd words over a certain length.  I can't disregard them, they create chains and combos that pummel my cerebral cortex.  They're obviously nonsense, but I can't help but create some rational context for them to operate in unity.  My favorite thus far has been ""Circumspect Gourd,"" which I simply must name a band after.  It really does evoke an especially cautious pumpkin.  


To make a long story short, if you use the full version of Outlook you really do need SpamBayes.  Out of 2049 messages, I've had one false positive.  Anything it isn't sure about goes into a folder called Junk Suspects, which you then use to teach the filter which mails about cocks are unsolicited.  The most important thing for me isn't that it is snaring Spam, as much as I hate that stuff.  It's a psychological shift that has allowed me to ""game"" my inbox and look at unsolicited mail in a new way.  I'm actually excited to get spam now, because every new entreaty from a nonexistent cheerleader improves my learning filter and reduces spammer efficiency.    


A couple updates for recent posts:




As regards the Star Wars Galaxies expansion Jump To Lightspeed, readers wrote in on a variety of topics.  One of the things I found odd about the angrier mails is that it appears to be an accepted fact that Galaxies is either incomplete or in desperate need of an overhaul, even by the grim-faced acolytes writing in to defend the game.  If there were a way to get in on the expansion without soiling myself interacting with the first game, they might have a deal on their hands.  It sounds as though the original game is in for an end of the month price cut, in addition to some new features that make it easier for new players which sweetens the deal a bit.  SWG Stratics is also compiling a FAQ to retain those queries which are often put forth.  People took me to task for not mentioning X-Wing: Alliance as the sequel to X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter, but I've always seen XvT (with it's multiplayer focus) as its own franchise, and the campaign based gameplay of Alliance to hearken back to the classic X-Wing or Tie-Fighter games.  You can still be displeased with me, but that was my rationale.  It should be noted that there is an upgrade project for X-Wing: Alliance to modernize some of the assets - just as Rebirth does for System Shock 2, let's say.  These upgraded models are also available in the Darksaber Ultimate Craft Pack.





Gabe has been well served by the PA forum thread we've mentioned, wherein people who are not fuckers post their Gamertags and then engage in rollicking rounds of online games with other people who are not dicks.  I've been informed by the inestimable Chewy that he's set up a league dedicated to this sort of activity expressly for European Live players, a link to which can be found here.

There is a Pandora Tomorrow Xbox 2v2 Tournament advertised over at Clan World Network. I've actually never heard of the site bepore and the rules for the tournament make it seem like they have no idea what the fuck they are doing. This is from their website:



""The Matches will be played with the neutralization game mode and 2 of the same map played twice. The team that hosts will let the other team pick the side they want to play. Then the teams will alternate. A Team wins by doing any of the objectives or killing the other team.""



That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. We're organizing our own SC tournament for PAX and it's actually not an easy game to devise a set of tournament rules for. The problem is that it's very likely that in a Neutralization game, set to revenge mode the mercs could win both rounds. So if each team wins as mercs and loses as spies, how do you decide who won the game? 


One way is to give the game to whichever team neutralized the most points as spies. It's possible that the mercs could totally shut out the spies in both rounds though. So do you just keep playing game after game until one team is able to neutralize a point as spies? It says on the site that a team wins by ""doing any of the objectives"". What the hell does that mean?  


Obviously I'm interested in a huge SC tournament over Live, and honestly I already signed my team up. I'd just like it if they come out with some rules that make a little more sense.


It's true that I really loved the Front Mission 4 demo. I credit Disgaea for actually getting me in to the turn based strategy genre. From there I went right in to FF:tactics and at that point there was no turning back. Something Tycho didn't really hit on is the new combo system in the game. You will see blue lines stretching out from each Wanzer to the other Wanzers it's connected to. Any unit connected to the attacking Wanzer by a blue line has the opportunity to join in the attack, assuming it's within range and has enough AP. With some planning and careful placement op your units on the battlefield, you can set up some devastating linked attacks. The same sets of rules apply to defense as well. This means that linked Wanzers can often join in counter attacks. The whole system is really intuitive once you see it.

I mentioned Disgaea yesterday and gave it credit for getting me into the tactical strategy genre. I wanted to mention that the follow up to Disgaea, La Pucelle: Tactics (which is actually more of a prequel than a sequel) is available now in stores. Disgaea was one of those games that stores didn’t order enough of and it was extremely hard to find after word got around that is was totally fucking awesonahadnwtl wanted to give you aycteorrds up on La Pucelle. I’m actually heading out this afternoon to pick up my copy so I’ll try and get some impressions up tomorrow.


I said I wasn’t going to bore you guys with baby stuff but we have a doctor’s appointment today and we’re going to find out if it’s a boy, girl or some kind of insect. People ask me at conventions and stuff how it feels, and I tell them I oscillate between absolute terror and incredible joy.

I've got a LAN this weekend at the venerable Ministry of Peace, and between that and E3 it it feels like bees are setting up shop in my lungs.  Perhaps for you, intense enthusiasm takes some other form.  For me, it's bees.


Not too long ago, I attended a LAN that was fairly small but still plenty of fun.  That's the way of LANs, when you plug machines into each other there is just a default level of fun that is created and that level tends to be fairly high.  But since everyone there pretty much gets along great, there was an element that was missing - furious anger.  I want the best for my friends, I good things to happen to them over the course of a day and I want to rejoice with them in triumph.  So if we're playing Jailbreak and all of our guys are imprisoned, I take a full accounting of my life and can usually find some offense for which I could rightly be incarcerated. 

MOP LAN parties are, in terms of barely contained rage, like a clandestine cockfight in some barn an hour outside of town.  The first time we attended one, we were forced to set up shop upstairs because the basement was full - this is already sounding like a parable.  We were outside of the continuum that composed the bulk of the party, and the signals our species produces to establish familiarity were attenuated.  The fact that we were physically situated above them, as though on a throne, as though on a gleaming starship over a wasted world was not lost on us.  The things that occur in their filthy warrens do not warrant consideration.  Indeed, those that dwell in such dark places to not merit membership in our club, a club whose only pre-requisite is humanity.


What I'm trying to tell you is that these Goddamn events are powder kegs.  We've switched from the longtime staple, Soldier of Fortune 2, which I think we've played for twelve days total now.  Unbelievably fun, if you haven't given it a shot somebody should put that on tap at the next LAN.  Grab all the patches, and have the admin install Orange Smoothie to keep the peace.  Anyway, we're moving over to UT2k4 for this one, CTF and Onslaught, which I already know is an absolute treat anytime bandwidth is not a consideration.  I'll go into E3 on Monday before we fly down to the event itself, a few readers wanted me to cover something first:  


Now that one can obtain Tribes 2 for free, it was suggested that we should again throw our support behind Team Aerial Combat 2 - this is something we have no problem doing.  We played nothing but TAC2 eventually.  Probably its most striking feature is that you die instantly if you touch the ground, so your vehicles are not only transportation and weaponry, they're life support.  You can (of course) walk freely on bases, bridges, any object is safe.  But when your team has left you swinging in the wind at some remote outpost, the isolation is a real thing you can feel with your entire body.  The game also has a robust assortment of original maps that will test your resolve, in addition to a really unique gametype called Retrieval.  In Retrieval, each team sends scouts out into the map to find the Artifact, which is placed at random.  Once visually acquired and marked with a beacon, one player drives out a Jericho to obtain it and bring it back while under heavy assault from enemy vehicles.  There are many reasons to like it, but in particular I like the naval feeling of the air combat as well as the fact that the huge transports have been toughened up and see heavy use over the course of actual games.  In base Tribes 2, those things were essentially futuristic pinatas.

La Pucelle has a number of systems for accomplishing various things, and young students at the eponymous demon hunting academy must face foes which frequently exceed Potterian standards.  Primary among these mechanisms is Purification, which not only allows you to close dark portals but can also bring an enemy around to your way of thinking.  Once converted you can train them up to improve their skills, or you may simply hurl them into battle against impossible odds.  It's really up to you.  Us, we go through about twenty bats a week.       


We head down to E3 at about noon tomorrow, so all my consumer electronics are feverishly lapping at the wall socket.  This is our fifth consecutive year there, and it is not something that ever wears or becomes tarnished.  What's more, it's really two conventions.  You have the event during the day, a howling pandemonium of fever-hot heat and suffocating sound, and then at night you have this reverse universe adjacent to the other one where everyone is drunk.  You see the people who make the games you like talking to each other on a set of stairs which are bathed in green light.         


Someone wrote in and asked me if, when we attend E3, Peter Molyneux runs up to me and just gives me a handjob right there, a question that betrays a level of ignorance about the handjob scene.  When two men meet, it's assumed that each person is at +1 handjob.  There's a brief period of ""discovery"" where deeply encoded statements are exchanged to determine if there are any modifiers to that roll, such as being heterosexual, which is itself negative ten thousand handjobs.  The trouble for me is that making Populous is +2000 handjobs, and Molyneux has made three of those Goddamn things.  It's +1500 for Powermonger, you know, +5000 for Syndicate, it goes on like that for a while.  The final tally is something like twenty thousand fucking handjobs.  I'd be there yanking on the guy for about a month.  The first few might be special, after that I'm just running down the clock.  I try to avoid him for this reason.         


We have had quite a lot of fun at the Phantom's expense, and it it would be sad to see those days go, but this article is fairly interesting.  Just in case you were wondering, this is what it looks like when someone with a head for marketing is brought on to solve issues with a brand.  We know many new things about the device:  a keyboard and mouse controller has been revealed, and you can subscribe to the service for different amounts, which allows access to different ""tiers"" of content - calling their system a ""Game Receiver"" serves to complete the image of the cable-esque service they're creating.  They'd also like to give the system away, provided you obtain a year of this service.  Game rentals will be available.  It appears to have a single port on the front, not a huge deal for multiplayer since I'm sure the whole thing is USB and you just daisychain or something, but I did have a vision of the after-now in which all controllers and indeed all peripherals utilize a wireless scheme like Bluetooth, and the console itself is smooth on the front, like a Ken doll.          


It will be interesting to see the language they employ to communicate their machine at E3 - my guess is that they will avoid referring to it as a console altogether now.  Conceptually, it created inconsistencies that (to my mind) muddied what they were trying to do and amplified gamer incredulity.  Saying that it's a ""console that plays PC games"" is, in the actual parlance of gaming, like saying that it is an appleorange.  It's incoherent.

There are hiking trails near Mount Rainer, and if you want to brave such things that's fine, but the forest service does ask that you bring a few emergency supplies.  This is probably to delay the onset of cannibal acts a few hours while rangers attempt to track down the next batch of city folk.  It was these terrifically useful items I removed by the handful from the pack Brenna had been using up there, and I was relatively certain that I had gotten it all by the time I began replacing that stuff with the things I'd want to die in a forest with, like ironic game shirts and a phone charger that fits any outlet.     


I never get stopped at those Airport Baggage things, no stranger ever diddles me with a latex glove because I am absolutely ordinary in every way.  So when I was made to wait without my shoes - which is oddly dehumanizing - a man I was not familiar with began to stir the contents of my bag like a large kettle.  I began to sass back in various ways regarding the dangerous Game Boy hinge or lethal mouse cord.  I don't know what made me do that.  Certainly the man did not enjoy it, and continued to insist that there was something really dangerous in there.  ""Probably not,"" I said, though I did bring a potentially hazardous box of mints to his attention. 


The security man proceeded to draw a long knife out of my bag.  The thing was practically a sword, and as he held that shape over the bag I could feel an frigid, unseen hand grip my scrotum.  The knife had a black wooden handle and a serrated edge.  It was not, in fact, a mint.  Or, if it was, this was the sort of mint you should eat only as a last resort.


His supervisor came over, holding the knife and looking at me as though I were an animal in need of a reprimand, a creature somewhat outside the reach of language.  ""This is a knife.""  I knew that much.  ""You can't bring it on the plane.""  I knew that too, actually.  They don't give that kind of shit back, by the way - the weapons you try to sneak on board?  Nope.  Turns out they keep that stuff.


So then I board the plane itself, and who should I see but Gabe Newell!  Valve is really from the same area we are - Zach has seen him a couple times as I understand it - but it's kind of cool to see someone involved with the legendary Half-Life, yardstick for all of  first-person gaming right there on your plane.  Half-Life 2, though, I'm sort of done thinking about it.  Obviously, I'm buying it the day it comes out, and probably over their much maligned Steam.  Supposedly they have something very nice to see here at this show.  But after a year of sites reposting the same ""new"" movies over and over, and with the September release date they knew they'd miss but let us believe in anyway, I have other things to think about.                  


Played Jungle Beat and Guild Wars, that's what we'll talk about next time - in addition to anything that strikes me tomorrow.  You can play Guild Wars yourself, right now - and you should, especially if you liked Phantasy Star Online or Diablo.  It's a pretty clean mix of those two games, and if invoking those hallowed franchises has stirred your heart just go grab the software.  Shit, I'll even host the Goddamn thing.  I uploaded a few screenshots this morning, but when I saw that the screens were twice the size of the actual client, I just couldn't see the point.  You can connect and play with your whole crew until E3 is over, and I really suggest you do.

I got the comic strip drawn fairly early and I told Tycho I was gonna hit the hot tub with some friends. He told me he was gonna stay in the room and write his news post. He made it very clear that if I came back and found him asleep that I should wake him up. Well the hot tub ended up being a warm tub and when I got back to the room Tycho was of course passed out in bed. I gave him a little nudge and said ""hey buddy, you told me to wake you up."" to which he replied ""go fuck yourself."" 


So I figured I'd leave sleeping beauty alone and just upload the new sketch myself. Often times at E3 I encounter a person that I am simply not high enough level to deal with. Tycho acts as my social meat shield in these situations. Like a conversation tank, he absorbs blow after blow while I stay in the background casting the occasional sarcastic remark.


We had our first of two signings at the Ubi Soft booth yesterday and it was totally fucking amazing. When I saw the line I actually got in it assuming it was for Half Life 2. I commiserated with the people around me about how long the fucking line was for nearly 10 minutes before I realized they were there to see me.  We handed out the first hundred comic books in just a few minutes. After that we signed anything people brought up to us. We have another hundred books to hand out today. So if you didn't get one on Thursday, stop by the booth again today at 1:00.


I've seen so many awesome games it's hard to keep them all straight. I played a bunch of Republic Commando today along with Mech Assault 2, Full Spectrum Warrior and Jade Empire. I also got my hands on The new Four Swords game for the Cube, Paper Mario and the Nintendo DS. There were a lot of surprises this year along with some pretty major disappointments. I'll get into all that once I get home and have time to do it right.

It may seem strange, but the first thing I did when I got home was play Rallisport Challenge 2.  You'd think that you spend three days at E3 playing games, and it just doesn't work that way.  You spend three days sampling small amounts of a couple hundred games, and those samples are typically drawn from such a truncated set of the entire game experience that it rarely satisfies.  Booting Rallisport was like finally enjoying an entire meal after some 72 hour hors d'oeuvre marathon.   


When given the choice, I typically start with the bad news.  


Final Fantasy XII:  I really don't know what's going on here, and it's possible that we're the only ones who aren't ready for a change in Final Fantasy combat.  Be assured:  that's what you're in for, change, and lots of it.  Obviously I have no problem with vastly more expressive models and lifelike lip-syncing.  Before now, I thought of Final Fantasy XI as following the series numerically, but of some unknown parentage that moved it slightly out of the line.  The reality is that the combat in FFXI and FFXII share a lot of similarities at the base level.  Combats aren't random, you see monsters right there in front of you and they occur on the map itself.  You run up to a monster (or they run up to you) and then the whacking begins.  The actions of your other party members are determined by ""Gambits,"" which are essentially behavior scripts.  You can pause the action at any time and see the blessedly familiar Action Menu, selecting the thing you'd like to use next - you can do this for other party members, too.  Characters are no longer arrayed in lines which make things like facing and position explicit.  I still have to buy the thing, it's Final Goddamn Fantasy.  But that doesn't mean I wont grit my teeth as I swipe the card.   


Killzone:  Honestly, I don't know what the big deal is.  Going by current release dates, Killzone itself will launch a week after Halo 2 - honestly, I'd just stop development right now.  I've played both, networked and all, and Killzone doesn't even rank Little Brother status.  There was some nice geometry, but it wasn't even ""Nice Geometry"" - it was just better and faster than I expected on the Playstation 2.  It's like when you see an old man hobble over to the mailbox all by himself.  Getting the mail is no herculean act.  And there is nothing startling or noteworthy about Killzone.     


PSP and the DS:  I'm sort of exhausted by this dialogue already, the false choice everybody has to adhere to.  One does not Have to like the DS and hate the PSP, nor does one have to like the PSP and hate the DS.  People are constantly exhorting me to throw in with either camp when, in my estimation, neither camp has earned my allegiance.


The PSP is, as is dangerously common in Sony personal electronics, so sexy you can feel it in the roots of your teeth.  You want to lick or bite it, it is a sleek lozenge.  It has a large, beautiful screen of impeccable clarity.  None of these things are open to discussion - you've either seen it or you haven't, and the industrial design is such that it represents some forgotten symbol that means Desire.  It should be thought of more as a Walkman, a ""Media Portable,"" than a straight game machine with its coming library of UMD format movies and audio playback in addition to being a handheld console - it's also a bit long.  I only want to know two things:  How much does it cost, and what is the battery life?  


I don't mean the battery life in their press kits, I want to know how long I can actually sit there and play a game on it with the screen at reasonable brightness.  I'm sold from a design perspective, of course I want one - find someone at E3 who didn't.  They have a list of developers as long as my arm.  The addition of the media capabilities pushes the device into the ""gadget"" realm, which I've historically been resistant to - how much is this thing going to cost?  When you see it, it's hard to believe they'd let that thing go for less than three hundred dollars, which is already twice or even three times as much as the full consoles on the market.  The reality is that I do not need a portable gaming machine.  All I need in the ""portable gaming"" space is a device that is inexpensive and good enough, and I've got two of those already.


The DS has to contend with the same issue - the Gameboy Advance SP pretty much hits all the notes I think most people are looking for.  No headphone jack, as we've lamented, but I bring that thing with me everywhere and the sound is usually off anyway.  It's one thing to crack out my SP in the movie line somewhere, it's another thing to make everybody listen to the Mario & Luigi music.  


The DS was actually the main thing I was looking forward to at E3, so it isn't fun to write this kind of stuff.  They haven't made a compelling case for it this year.  There is a room you can go to and play ""games"" on it, but none of these are actual games, they're more like Tech Demos.  They show you ways in which the touch screen and stylus can be used together, and I will admit that I found it much more compelling than I expected to.  A vegetable will shoot up, and I will cut it with a flick of the stylus, that kind of thing.  One gets a sense of what they mean.  But without a complete game experience, we can only imagine what kinds of things they intend the device to accomplish.  It would be like if you saw a giraffe, but had no knowledge of trees.  It would just be a large animal with kind of an odd neck that seemed superfluous.

I feel like I need to emphasize that the strip does not exaggerate the game in question or add things where things do not exist.  You really do ""possess"" a bowl of dog food in an effort to terrify a dog, which can then be possessed itself in that state - indeed, there are more than four hundred breeds of dog, each with their own statistics, which makes Geist the Gran Turismo of dog scaring.  


One of the weird things about Penny Arcade trying to cover E3 is that - precisely because I enjoy video games - I actively avoid some of them because there are things I don't want to know.  To go to a media event whose explicit function is the dissemination of information and then spend days cowering from it is something truly ridiculous, but I really would like some gaming event in the next two years to have some bit of novelty associated with it.  So, for example, all I could tell you about Thief: Deadly Shadows is that a) I'm happy the franchise did not disintegrate, and b) there really is the most fetching graphical effect when Garret is in the dark, which we can assume will be often.  When he's illuminated, it's like ""Hey, there's a thief,"" but in the dark they have chosen just to accent just the edges of cloth and leather with a tasteful, almost illustrated glow, like moonlight.  Let me scare up a screenshot for you, though you really do need to see it move.  I'm fairly excited for this game, but it's not really based on anything since I've sworn off real knowledge about it.  I even look forward to the ability to play in third person, which I understand is somewhat heretical.         


What I saw of Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich was alright, and their whispered intimations about a wholly new type of multiplayer storyline-based gameplay was invigorating, but I might have been hoping for a more significant visual leap.  I don't mean pixel shaders or something, I'm saying that they have a wonderful, compelling cast of genuine characters and a naive world on the brink that I want to see better realized.  They are moving to Gamebryo, a new version of their engine, the effects of which we weren't able to see - but I'm not really talking about technology, I'm talking about aesthetics.  The inspired art that drew me into the game in the first place only gets seen in loading screens, and then crude facsimiles of those characters take their place in the game world.  This was fine when the first Freedom Force hit, with a magical quality that seized our minds.  I hope you'll forgive me when I say it's time for the series to make good on its artistic promise.  


From the story outline we were given - and a wonderfully melodramatic new origin movie for newcomer Nathan Graves, a.k.a Tombstone - we'll be well served, which is exactly what I expect from Irrational.  The levels will be more dense with interactive objects, as well as that dynamic lighting the kids are always talking about.  Modifications and custom content will be automagically packaged and sent to opponents or comrades.  Cool new powers and new progressions for old characters are in.  Visually, though, it doesn't feel like a sequel should.  Maybe I'm not being fair, but Freedom Force is one of my pet franchises and I'm allowed to be partial.   


Speaking of another Irrational game - Tribes: Vengeance - I walked up a steel staircase and played it a bit as well, but my experience - hitchy vehicle control, poor prediction on the LAN, things like that - isn't something I've seen echoed from other quarters.  It is because of this that I've decided to do something drastic, something that may well change the face of history.  I am turning to Tribal War - yes, Tribal War, our eternal enemy - for their take on it.  They go map by map, weapon by weapon, and deliver a fairly exhaustive chunk of coverage that will likely answer your questions, as much as it may pain me to admit it.

People kept saying ""why don't you talk about the new Zelda, why don't you talk about the new Zelda"" and we have done so.  There's also a lesson here, about being careful what you wish for, because we may append space dogs or the apocalypse to your initial request.  I hope that everyone has learned their lesson.


The actual reason Zelda was not discussed was because even though we attended the E3 event, we can add no context to the same videos you have already seen online - that's all we got, too.  The press kit breathlessly emphasizes that Link is more grown up, that there will be treasure (which we're all for), and that it will have a storyline.  That's not exactly the book of Revelation.


The only thing we can tell you that you don't already know is that you're not the only person to be enthralled by this new video.  Many people say they want Nintendo to grow up, or become something different in order to appease them, I've probably said these things myself.  I don't actually want that, though.  What I want is Nintendo to put out sequels to successful franchises that are so good, that are so inventive and simple and startling that I remember what it is about them that first captured me.  Yes, it is only a video showing a character which many of us adore riding a horse and fighting demons underground, but it made many, many people smile just to look at it.  Even the people in the line to see the DS smiled, a line of such legendary length that the end purpose of it had lost meaning for some people.  A hierarchy was established based on line position and odd ceremonies accompanied even the most ordinary activities.  


The cube has some real gems coming up this year, information that I hope will bolster the stalwart enthusiasts that remain true to the company even in these lean times.  I don't know if you heard, but Resident Evil 4 is now an extremely gritty action game with Shenmue's ""Quick-Time Events"" in for good measure - different situations will arise that call for a timed button press right in the middle of play, and while failing these typically won't result in your death, not being sawn in half with a chainsaw is its own reward.  The game is gross, too, with buckets of blood and extremely odd - though apparently human - opponents.  I was trying to figure out what Resident Evil would be without the, you know, zombies, but it would appear that the experience is quite valid.  I actually find it more unpleasant that a person would cut through my torso while fully cognizant of the fact. 


They had two new particularly striking RPGs, Tales of Symphonia and Baten Kaitos, that should inspire a sigh of relief from cube owners craving access to that elusive genre.  I'm sorry to say that I avoided Metroid Prime 2 for the same reasons I avoided Thief 3 - though Gabe played it a bit, and even tried out the deathmatch with some amusement as I understand it.  Maybe we can coax him into a more extended discussion.  The Advance Wars for the cube is a travesty and insult to the virtuous people of the world, as it is a lukewarm action game and not a beautiful tactical experience in three dimensions.  I'd like to tell you if Killer 7 was going to be good, but the trailer they kept showing looks like a montage of clips from the dreams of serial killers.  I don't know what to tell you.  Mario Tennis, it would seem, is much more than expected.      


I have two favorite games from the show, and one of them is for the cube - you might already have heard of Donkey Konga, indeed, you might already have imported the game as we did.  It is one of these games like Samba De Amigo where you attach some unlikely peripheral - in this case, a small set of plastic bongo drums - to your console and then play games based entirely around that controller.  There are four total ""states"" on the drum  - right bongo, left bongo, both bongos, and ""clap,"" where clap can really be any sufficiently loud, sharp sound.  Stay with me, Donkey Konga isn't my favorite game of the show.  You play songs and unlock more difficult versions of songs with money you receive playing, you can even buy new ""sounds"" for the drums to play in the songs.  The way we typically went about it was to have a person (or ""Band leader"") play through the actual drum portions, and have the other people in the room do the claps.  We've found that it works best if the band leader jabs a hand up in the air when you're supposed to clap, it tends to spur the room into action and also it makes you feel like you are controlling other people's bodies, which is awesome.


But now it's like the Steel Battalion yoke - what the fuck are you supposed to do with that thing now?  They're plastic bongos, you can't pass that shit off as decor.  Well, Capcom released a multiplayer version of Steel Battalion called Line Of Contact that made you feel about three percent less stupid for buying their monstrous controller.  For these bongos, you go and get Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat, which is actually cooler than the original game by an order of magnitude.


This is pretty much what I'm talking about when I say I want Nintendo to remind me what it is about these simple, pure concepts that is so compelling.  Jungle Beat is a 2D sidescroller rendered entirely in 3D, so already I'm starting to feel warm.  To run right, you roll the right bongo.  Left, well, you know.  Both drums jumps, hitting them again in mid-air bops.  Clapping initiates an action, like grabbing bananas or punching a pig.  So, with this basic palette of actions, you need to navigate comely jungle and arctic scenarios in ways that feel oddly intuitive.  Now I've gotten ahold of some weird bird - it looks like each bongo is a wing on that bird, and I can fly where I want to with a moment's experimentation.  Now I'm being flung around after swinging on trees, or vines - when I hit the wall, I can hit the drum facing away from it to leap, left and right, up the corridor.  Here is a boss, a gigantic ape, that I must box - swinging right and left - using the bongo controller.  It's possible that this is what they're getting at with the DS, natural interfaces, though I'll get to that in a moment - but it really felt like I was beating the shit out of that monkey.  Using the interface itself to create a greater level of symmetry between my actions and the actions perpetrated in-game managed to entirely transport me into a wild jungle.  This does happen with controllers on occasion, though for immersion I do tend to prefer the PC mouse with its motion analogous to my own head and neck.  But these stupid drums were able to capture the essence of platforming in a way that the efficient, though abstract gamepad does not.     


People wanted to know why I was so ""down"" on the Nintendo DS, when I thought I'd made it fairly clear.  I'm not down on it just so I can prove my resistance to novelty and thus secure my position as the arbiter of your amusement.  The Nintendo DS was the reason I went to E3.  And when I got there, they had a few technology demos that showed how a stylus could be a legitimate interface, but none of the game concepts they showed were actually complete.  The Metroid: Hunters thing you might have read about, a multiplayer Metroid Deathmatch, was almost indecipherable as a game experience.  You use the d-pad to move around, and the stylus to determine not only what direction you are facing, but also to shoot, by tapping on your opponent.  If it seems cool, I'm not explaining it right.  In practice, you are covering up the screen - where, as you might recall, things happen - in order to accomplish the most basic movement tasks.  I'm not opposed to the DS on some fundamental level.  But they need to show me what makes that way of doing things better, and that didn't happen at this show.


I've talked forever, and I never got to the GBA.  Monday, we'll get to it on Monday.

Troy ain't that hot.  That's not what we're here to talk about today, though.


Perhaps in penance for some past or future sin, I was made to languish in accursed Spokane for the weekend.  Peals of grating static on the radio preceded a Tornado Warning as we entered the ""city,"" conjuring images of the tin-roofed shanties so common there flung into the air, hopefully to land in some hospitable town.  As I wove between biblically proportioned funnel clouds, it occurred to me that though I'd spent an entire post on games for the Cube I hadn't even discussed some of my favorites.  


Fire Emblem is en route to the Cube in a form we'd actually recognize, i.e. tactical strategy, and has not been buried in some shallow grave while a hideous monster capers in its loosely draped, not-fooling-anybody skin.  Starfox has returned in rail-shooter regalia plus co-op, overcoming fleets and spaceborne robots while his animal pals - rocked by precision enemy ordnance - burst into flames.       


Paper Mario 2 was very nearly one of my top games, in a different mood or perhaps very late at night things might have been different.  If you're already down with Paper Mario, or you're a recent inductee with the somewhat related Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, then I don't need to tell you that combining role-playing mechanics with straight-up platform gameplay basically rocks the fucking house.  Screens of the game aren't bad, you can get a sense of the aesthetic, but if you'd like to see what it is to play a Saturday morning cartoon I really do recommend the video.  The RPG style battles occur on a rudimentary set, something like a school play, and you can impress your audience to kick out special moves.    


Tucked in the back left of the booth, on the side of a display facing away from their area, Nintendo hid a game called Odama.  The genre given by the press kit is ""military pinball,"" which is not actually a genre in any hierarchy I know about.  You might be curious to know what that means, exactly.  Coming across something like a pinball RTS, you have armies that exist in the playing field - these armies accomplish your will, excavating additional flippers and affecting the ""board,"" i.e. the battlefield.  Aside from the epic flippers and huge stone sphere - which I do not believe are drawn from historical Japan - the screen itself looks like actual terrain rather than a series of explicit targets.  You have what amounts to a massive, magical pinball that can be used to crush enemy defenses and convert troops to your cause.  What we were showed is probably a long way off, but as a concept it felt strong enough to belong in the booth.  


They also announced their new console, although this didn't happen at the booth proper - it happened at some briefing thing before the show, which we typically don't attend.  They called it Revolution, which as a word has been stripped of nearly all its power, ranking it somewhere between Wheat and Plastic.  At any rate, all they said was that it was going to do something to the paradigm and that ""if we thought of a console as something that hooked into a television and played games, we were in for a surprise.""


The mind reels.

We saw an article posted on Blue's News yesterday regarding a new sort of royalty calculation for games that use Warner Brothers licenses - you can read comments from the CEO of Atari and others responding to the concept.  Essentially, and the basic idea is not offensive to me, developers start to lose money if their games review less than an average of 70%.  People might understandably be worried about attempts to ""game"" that system, or that it might introduce a sort of mercenary review structure where cash money is dispensed in exchange for higher scores.  The thing is, top tier review sites are almost allergic to scores below seven - except in cases where they rate from one to five, of course - so I don't know how much money really needs to change hands to get the results they crave.  What's more, I don't know why the addition of ""money"" is fundamentally worse than the current staples of the reviewing industry, ""sloth"" and ""ineptitude.""


Okay, okay, last Nintendo day, I promise.       


One of the games I was excited about just came out, I picked it up yesterday - Mario Vs. Donkey Kong.  This is what I mean when I say that Nintendo makes ""pure"" games, though I never take the next step and define that term.  I'm saying that they make a kind of ""toy,"" something to amuse yourself with.  As technology has improved, and has gamers have gotten older, the games have gotten a lot more complex.  This is not something I have a problem with, really.  Stories have become of greater importance, again, this isn't something I'm going to complain about.  But to play a game for the game's sake, because it's fun to actually play it, because it is made up of tiny, valid choices in a context which rewards the classic gaming virtues of timing and focus - that's where Nintendo excels.  It is for this reason that I understand why there is antipathy toward Nintendo for the anachronistic way they behave sometimes.  Gaming has moved on, yes, but they cradle some primal moment in perfect, perpetual genesis.  I had some experience with the NES and SNES as a child, but I grew up playing a very different sort of game on the Commodore 64 - on a sort of personal computer, where games of fractal, folded in on itself complexity had already taken root.  Playing Nintendo games, then and now, is like a colonic by comparison.       


Obviously, I don't give a fuck about Hamtaro, I have no desire to unite Ham-Hams.  He is like every Anime munchkin boiled down and refined, the real McCoy, so pure in its dose that he must be cuddled at all costs.  We will not be discussing him today.  


If I tried to describe Mario vs. Donkey Kong, I don't think it would sound all that hot.  The gameplay itself is really just series of ""abilities,"" a sort of All Star Team of Mario techniques from games spanning decades, like the ability to jump on top of things and pick them up, big back flips, hammers, and a few new tricks.  He can even climb these vine things, similar to Donkey Kong Junior.   Essentially, each level takes place in a factory type setting, with the requisite ladders, girders, and conveyors - buttons placed around the level will radically alter its structure.  It is, at its core, a platform game of such honed execution that it will have a hold of you before you realize EB has closed around you, it is dark, and the employees are waiting to go home.        


You might have heard about the Classic NES series, especially if you watch sites that cover import gaming - Nintendo is selling the old NES games for the GBA now.  You'd think after I talked about perfect genesi and what not that I might be slavering for them, but I find myself quite resistant to it.  Selling new versions of old games, yes - selling old versions of old games for new systems breaks the compact I have with them.  Gabriel is more of a collector than I am, it's possible that this kind of thing appeals to him.  Paying 20 dollars for each individual game is right out.  It was one thing to release these games on cards that you could then feed into your E-Reader or whatever, then it was kind of a novelty thing, a trick.  As a cool unlockable after you beat a game, hey, alright.  When they put it right there on a cartridge, everybody knows what they're doing.


I am not, myself, a Pokemon master - I do not ""catch them all.""  So I don't know if this year's new Freakzor is more potent in some fundamental way than Whoremon.  However, just as in Japan, there is a wireless adapter that comes bundled with it, allowing you to get down all wireless and shit.  Now, it does not function as I had hoped - i.e., that it would be clever enough to simply convert the communication of regular games into some short range signal - games must be coded explicitly to take advantage of it.  Mario Golf: Advance Tour supports the device as well, but it's not bundled with the wireless adapter.  On the other hand, it does play out like a Golf RPG in miniature, and allows you to transfer your character back and forth from the Cube.  All is not lost.


Majesco has a device coming out that will convert the ordinary link cable port into a wireless signal, but I don't know much about it besides that. 


There were some other games there that intrigued me, the Mario Party Advance, the Mario Pinball, which even on the GBA screen has no scrolling.  Capcom's Legend Of Zelda: The Minish Cap is beautiful to look at, and feels like an SNES game that was locked in a time capsule for a time when the world needed it.  But for GBA games this year, it didn't get any better for me than DK: King of Swing. 


You only play the game with the shoulder buttons, let's start there.  It's a kind of arcade puzzle game, where each button controls a hand, pressing and releasing both buttons causes Donkey Kong to leap.  The thing is, as you are climbing up different surfaces, Donkey Kong naturally swings in one direction, so if you want him to stop doing that, you grab something else with your other hand and climb up that way, swinging between points.  Obviously, there's assholes also climbing around there, you have to get bananas and so forth, he can't get enough of those things.  But the basic conceit is so enjoyable for me in practice that I want to go door to door, asking people if they know who the Goddamn king of swing is. 

 
The girl that was running demos of the game actually wouldn't let me play at first.  ""Hold on,"" she said.  ""I'm trying to beat this level.""  I got the impression that she had been trying for a while.  She eventually let me try my hand at it, promising me her entire saddlebag full of Nintendo tchotchkes, which she said contained quite a lot of whatever was in there.  I didn't have shit, though - she was on a level that far exceeded my abilities, one that combined the quick decision making you already had to do with some puzzle shit, as climbing from point to point made other climbing points appear.  I gave it back to her, and she beat it right away.  Maybe she just needed a break.  I don't know if she just kept the whole bag for herself then, or what.

I got 2000 emails about the Twisp and Catsby print in less than two days. I think it's safe to say you guys want them. Let me try and answer some of the questions I got regarding how it might work.


How big will they be?


The prints will probably be in the neighborhood of 16x24. 


How many will you make?


Right now I'm thinking 500 to 1000


How much are these fuckers going to cost?


I'm not exactly sure yet but I'd guess between $50 and $75


Will you make more when they run out?


No. Let me break down exactly what a limited edition print is. I'm an idiot for not explaining this in my last post.


Limited-edition prints are very high quality reproductions of original paintings or drawings, produced in strictly limited quantities by specialty printing firms under contract to a fine arts publisher. The edition is printed, with input and final approval by the artist, on high quality acid-free archival paper. Each individual print is hand-signed and numbered by the artist.
The publisher of a limited-edition supplies a Certificate of Authenticity with each print, certifying the number of prints in the edition and confirming that the plates and negatives used in printing the edition have been destroyed and no more prints will ever be produced, thus making the edition limited. 
An edition of 500 prints would be considered relatively small; an edition of 1,500, large.
When all prints in a limited edition are sold, continuing demand usually causes the print value to appreciate - often substantially.


Essentially what we'd be making here are highly collectible (perhaps eventually valuable) pieces of Penny Arcade art. These are certainly not going to be for everyone. I promise that we'll keep making posters with all the characters you want. But for some people, owning a limited edition print could be a real treat. I know I personally have a couple from artists whose work I appreciate.

When can I get one?


I plan on having two prints available for unveiling by the San Diego comic con in July. After the con they should be available via the online store.


If I don't get one I'll come to your fucking house and kill you while you sleep.


This isn't really a question, but it popped up enough that I felt like I should comment on it. Judging by the incredible response I got it seems to me like a line of Penny Arcade limited edition prints is in order. I promise that we will have multiple designs with various characters and assuming they continue to be popular, I'd like to see us release a few new ones each year. I think they would make really nice collectibles.

Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay is actually one of the games I was going to talk about, so I'll just link the strip concerning it and then we'll move forward like normal.


Escape From Butcher Bay (see, I told you) looks really, really good.  To properly emphasize it would require the use of many more exclamation points that I am comfortable with.  The fact that it's so remarkable visually shouldn't surprise anybody, because it's from Starbreeze - coming up up on the mean streets of Sweden's demo scene, coding just to stay alive, they were honing the skills that would one day be put forth in Riddick.  Not only does it look good, which we could see for ourselves there at E3, the reviews we've read seem to imply that the period where you could comfortably disregard movie tie-ins like this is either over or briefly suspended.  It's coming out this week, incidentally.  If you'd like to know more, then by all means check out this interview with screenshots over at 1up.        


You may remember that I applauded the decision to go a different direction with Unreal Championship 2, the original Unreal Championship for the Xbox having the character of reheated leftovers.  Now, having had some experience with it, I am utterly resolute in my affections:  UC2 is completely excellent.  It rides a rugged all-terrain vehicle in the valley between the Fighting and Shooter genres, with striking, all-new weapon designs and unique melee weapons for each character.  The characters themselves are based on the teams we know from Unreal Tournament, but are far more stylized - they aren't just avatars, they seem like the more defined entities you might select in a fighting game.  My favorite feature is probably the same as anybody else's:  you can jump off any wall in an extended, Woo-style science fiction ballet.  It kept the matches we had moving along at a good pace, and further distinguished it from its traditional shooter heritage.  Videos, are, of course, available.   


I had a misconception initially about how Mechassault 2 was going to work, I thought there was a sort of armored suit (like an Elemental or something) that was your default, and you could get in other vehicles from there.  Not so.  You are actually a tiny guy with a shiny helmet, flesh and bones, and you can look out at the battlefield and see walking tanks crest the ridge.  You don't even start in a Mech - what amounts to your ""side"" of the map is like the Used Car Lot of the future, with air vehicles, tanks, and battlemechs waiting for human players to leap in.  Wearing the Battle Armor allows you to hitch rides on player piloted flying craft, climb up buildings, or even steal enemy mechs by defeating their pilot in a quick, ""hit the right button"" minigame.  By accident or design, the original Mechassault put action gameplay and big robots together in a way that was very appealing to a lot of people, including our own Mech King.  Playing a multiplayer round of the sequel, you can tell they have retained the pace the set in the first game - only now, everything looks fucking bad-ass and runs better.     

We've got another day of Xbox coverage, easy, but I need to just put on the record that you could walk down the aisles there in the booth - through clumps of kiosks emulating natural formations - and not make it ten consecutive feet because there was something you really wanted to see.  Silent Hill 4 was there, and if Electronic's Boutique is to be believed it hits Playstation 2 and Xbox on the same day - that's great to hear.  Republic Commando does more to bolster the beleaguered Star Wars fan than Lucas himself seems capable of doing.  Oh look, here's Forza, a racing game that lets you hook three Xboxes together to see front, left, and right.  Here's one of the most beautiful games of the show, and it's Conker for Christ's sake.  You couldn't throw a rock without hitting something worth looking into.

Both stories in this strip are true, true, true.  There was even a time when another player took an opportunity between rounds to strike his girlfriend, producing a haunting crack and a yip, but it was difficult to find the joke in it.


I've taken many opportunities to ridicule Fable over the years, largely because I thought it would never actually appear, so it was like making fun of a mythological creature and not really a source of danger.  As a result, I haven't taken any time the last few years to hear the appointment-only hyperbolic manifestos that have accompanied the game since it was announced.  So, seeing Fable playable out on the floor was like seeing a row of systems, and then a waving dragon, and then another row of systems on the other side.  What I played - which is to say, what they chose to show me - was extremely good.  Last year was the Year of ""X"" May Cry, as game after game and developer after developer laid claim to the high-speed, cinematic combat of Devil May Cry.  This year was definitely The Year Of The Glow, as soft light permeated many of the games present.  Fable really owns it, though - its peculiar, attractive aesthetic absolutely lends itself to a sort of grim fairy tale, which I must admit they have nailed spot on.  The combat I was able to play was action oriented, but it was not so fast paced that it got away from you or that each button press lost meaning.  Plenty of videos available at the MS site for it, if you'd like to learn more. 


To see E3 close down is really a sight, as the moment the clock strikes men emerge from shadow and dismantle the entire affair instantaneously.  Everything - as you are walking out, a man will literally be pulling the rug out from under your feet.  It was in this disintegrating state that we entered the small, private Bethesda booth, and since these people were all busy tearing their room apart I could walk right into the back unhindered.  I slinked to the back of their room, snatching up an Xbox gamepad and blindly navigating the menus of Call Of Cthulhu: Dark Corners Of The Earth.  I was lucky to have found the guys that showed me the game last year, two foreigners, and since we already sort of understood where the other was at I was able to see it pretty quickly.  The presentation they gave was almost identical to the one I'd seen before, actually - save one major thing:  a vastly improved engine.  Before, I saw an eviscerated man kept alive via unnatural means and it certainly seemed uncomfortable for him.  Now, the entire affair was completely disgusting, glistening, and gross.  Other scenes I'd witnessed before took on convincing light and particle effects that cemented the otherworldy nature of the events, and in a game whose entire role is to provide a convincing look at surreal entities it needs to have the reality down-pat first - their new technology lets them do that.  The vile Shoggoth gleamed with unseemly moisture, and the factory that surrounded him looked very much as it should, which is what makes it work.  It is really like an adventure game played in the first person, and while gunplay is certainly possible it's really not a focus.  We had a chance to see some of the insanity effects in play, warping and blurring vision.  I thought this might actually hinder gameplay, and I told them so, and they remarked that they were turned up somewhat for the demo just to emphasize them - in actual play, they'll be a bit more tasteful and cinematic than what I saw.  The eventual result of massive sanity loss is actually suicide - a chilling animation to see in first person, I can tell you, as the barrel of the pistol is raised to your temple.    


Fans of the Mythos, never fear - their first allegiance is to Howard Phillips Lovecraft, perhaps even to their detriment.  This is a game for fans of his surreal horror that is so genuine I'm not sure it would take hold in the larger gaming community.        


Speaking of Xbox games, two exclusives hit retail today:  Chronicles of Riddick, which we discussed on Monday and is apparently the second coming of Christ, and Full Spectrum Warrior, which I have praised to the skies since seeing it last year.  It has thus far received extremely favorable reviews, but here at this late hour I'm trying to guard my optimism a bit.  I've been so enthusiastic for so long that no human endeavor could possibly warrant it.

It's never me that suggests comics with religious overtones, the big bad atheist, oh no - it's Gabriel, the ""Catholic""!

Was he trying to say that Christians are pedophiles?  You've read his posts.  Does subtlety really strike you as his thing?  If he wanted to conflate religion and pedophilia, trust me - you would catch the meaning.


On the other hand, even as a Godless pagan, getting Riddick and Full Spectrum Warrior on the same day does seem to imply a greater framework of benevolence than could be managed by finite beings.  Finite is actually a good word to describe the games in question.  I'm going to stick with it.  Neither of these games overstays their welcome, which is a polite way of saying that they are short.      


When it comes to Chronicles of Riddick, this Escape from Butcher Bay thing, I really do have to throw in with the large body of reviewers on this one.  It is not absolute bliss, after reading their accounts I expected to be transported to a land which knows not care nor worry.  But it is very, very good.  


It's interesting that the game should hit immediately after our extended discussion on the abysmal quality of many licensed titles, as it is almost like a visual aid to help elucidate the way forward.  These are the things the game establishes:  First, the title should be used to add contour and gradient to the existing property - not merely repackage the film plus interactivity.  That's a pretty important distinction, how the license can inherently break the simulation.  If my only two choices are to a) continue the preordained story from the movie or b) die, those don't actually count as choices.  You have a single choice and the consequences of making that choice.  If being interactive means that my decisions are relevant, in the context of a movie narrative - a kind of discrete, linear destiny - in real terms, volition is nonexistent.    

So, Riddick sidesteps that by being a prequel that details important developments in the character.  The second lesson is that voice talent needs to be of even quality.  I don't even want to think about how many janitors or friends of the producer I've had to tolerate in games, busting right through even the best ones and forcibly ejecting me from a more pure translation into the experience.  I'd imagine it's the ""Universal"" part of Vivendi Universal that helped the most with this, but this thing has some of the most pristine voice work to date.  Make a note of it:  actors pretend to be other people as their job.  And if you want to see just how much a voice can bridge that wide span between a 3D model and a human being, go rent The Chronicles of Riddick.      


So, original story, don't skimp on the voices.  These aren't bad things for any game, but when we're talking about converting a cinematic property they're critical.  Riddick throws in something that isn't, in my opinion, necessary - but when added to the other two creates the startled look you see on these reviewers.  It has flashes of technical brilliance.  This is the sort of graphical presentation we should be expecting at this point.  They aren't next generation graphics, even - it's the way this generation should look, and Farcry is the only other game that comes to mind which really presents the argument for modern hardware.  The game isn't long enough for the honeymoon period to be over, even by the end you'll still be marvelling at just how immersive an environment can be when its surfaces capture and reflect light properly.    

We've reached the last paragraph, which is where I traditionally say the bad things and then tell you not to worry about them.  The level design is very much of the Quake school, corridors aplenty, crates, and so on.  I do not find it particularly bold or inspired, though I guess you are in a prison.  We've come to expect a bit more from games geometry wise, but I think you'll find yourself able to forgive it - the pacing is right, the hand-to-hand combat is visceral.  It's a fun game that I can recommend with absolutely no remorse.

The charge that the gameplay in Full Spectrum Warrior doesn't change much is fair in my opinion, but why that's not relevant to me is something we can discuss in a second.  The notion that Army brass would wait to reveal the infantry's ultimate techniques amused us though, and we went with it.


I really do think there must be something weird about how I play videogames.


I can recall reading the lamentations on some board somewhere about the hidden ""treasure"" in Return To Castle Wolfenstein, his concern being that there was no real impetus to obtain these baubles.  I couldn't help thinking to myself, it's treasure.  That's why you obtain it.  Treasure is inherently desirable.  It is only when you have abstracted the entire experience that you conclude that a pile of gold bars does not merit further investigation. 


The argument against Full Spectrum Warrior goes something like this:  once you have completed the nearly hour long tutorial, you have seen all the game has to offer gameplay wise.  You can't really argue with that, it's true.  The tutorial is designed to cover all of the commands you can issue to your squad, and let you see them played out in a simulation course.  In genre terms, it would be called Real-Time Strategy, though they've locked the camera right down with the individual units.  Think about it like Tetris, or some other puzzle game, because the comparison is instructive.  You are aware from the outset regarding the shape and function of all the pieces in your repertoire.  You know where they go and can plan accordingly.    


The game itself, then, tasks you with utilizing those techniques in new terrain and under heavy fire.  We've played almost exclusively in co-op, you can go through the main campaign that way, so like in any cooperative game communicating strategies and providing point and suppression fire are as much a part of the game as anything else.  Yes, you do move from cover to cover.  Yes, you provide fire support to Alpha or Bravo team, respectively.  There is no point at which hideous mutant monkeys emerge, which is by now so deeply entrenched that when we do not see these monkeys we think that something must be wrong.    


So, when Gabriel and I are merely moving through a hostile foreign country and merely suppressing enemy positions as we hop from cement wall to parked car to stone fountain and merely calling in an AH-64 Apache gunship to wreck a piece of enemy armor, I should be disappointed with that?  That's something I can't explain to you.  I don't go out of my way to see through the simulation, to reduce every game element to an array of distinct significants which can then be individually quantified.  I like big words, but while I don't mind playing the intellectual about games I try to avoid intellectualizing play itself.  I'm not trying to ""beat"" the game by removing the component parts of the experience, looking at them out of context, and then congratulating myself for being so fucking smart.


If you do give it a shot, through some combination of rentals and purchases obtain two copies, complete your training, and just start it out in co-op mode.  If you had the means to do so, I don't know why you'd play it any other way.

We have finally assembled our All Star Team for Legend Of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, and like the Planeteers our membership spans the globe.  We did run into a snag initially, but it's not really something I want to talk about.


Many people attend E3 by proxy through me, as I will go and look at specific things for them and then report back.  Quite a number of readers were curious about Dawn of War, Relic's RTS based on the Warhammer 40k universe, and when I did not put it front and center they feared the worst, some even going to so far as to suggest that I had been corrupted by the forces of Chaos.  Just to get it out of the way, fear is the last emotion you should maintain regarding the progress on Dawn of War.  The reason I haven't gotten to it was that I spent several days in the post walking through the Nintendo booth, as I had grown somewhat angry that their offerings this year were being dismissed as inconsequential.  Of course, then the Xbox fans took me to task for focusing on their sworn enemy, so I had to redistribute the affection.  And, right on cue, the Sony Army made their will known on the subject shortly thereafter.  I'm going to reclaim my front page now and cover topics which are of interest to me personally.  I feel confident that you will be able to find information regarding upcoming releases for the dominant console in the market elsewhere.  Here, we're talking about Dawn of War.


I was not sold on the game initially.  Like many other unreformed dorks, what I refer to in my internal nomenclature as Mark Ones, the fact that people keep taking Games Workshop franchises and making them Real Time when there is already a perfectly viable, world famous turn-based system causes me to howl with rage.  For me, the thing that brought me over initially was how much their entire execution says about their respect for Warhammer.  From the little grots sleeping on their watch atop the ramparts of an Ork stronghold to the Squad of Space Marines praying to the Resource Points, the balls of random junk the Orks fly in from offworld to build their structures to the inclusion of the absolutely critical Morale system, this is anything but a license cash in.  They didn't have to let us customize our own Chapters of Space Marines or any other side, creating our own banner graphics for the model carrying the Standard and generating wholly unique color schemes.      


The other reason I did not reserve a place in my heart for the game was the screenshots really didn't do anything for me.  It wasn't that they were terrible, they looked pretty much like the figurines.  But when your models are on the table, it's easy to imagine the battles that are taking place - and they're not static or staid.  Yes, it's turn based when you play it on the tabletop, but I have always had the sense that they were about to move, that when I turned my head the Emperor's will was being done back there.  Please let me emphasize to you that screenshots are possibly the worst way to experience this game.  Dawn of War has the most dynamic combat of any RTS I've ever seen.  It isn't just the ""blowback,"" imagined so well in Lord of The Rings, where with a single swipe from a unit of great size or power can send infantry flying.  Massive demons with axes can snatch up an Eldar, pop him up in the air, and bring his axe across the limp body like a Louisville Slugger.  I saw too many examples of this to name - units grabbing other units and going through almost revolting custom kills, smaller units that enact nearly ten second custom attack animations against larger foes, to look at the battlefield in Dawn of War is to see hundreds of units with considerable size variations, with many completely custom interactions.  A few units on each side going ""pew, pew"" with their far future ordnance would have been enough, but they're trying to do it right.             


Speaking mechanically, the reason interactions like these can work is that you do not create individual units and then group them.  Space Marines were the example they showed us, so that's the same I'll use here:  a Squad can be created at a barracks or delivered from orbit in a Drop Pod, but it is actually multiple units - five, if memory serves.  They move and fight as a single entity, and the game keeps track of it, so when these special attacks I was talking about come into play the game doesn't make a big deal of it - the Squad just loses a model.  What's more, now that you have your squad there, you ""create"" units to the squad - want a Heavy Bolter in there?  Each Squad has it's own build buttons down at the bottom, new guys can be produced on the fly, and when they're ready they appear with their brothers.  There are no resources, at least, not ones you gather in the classic sense - points around the map are captured and produce a stream of points for you to do with as you will.            


RTS is not my genre of choice, but they have proven that the spirit of Warhammer 40k can survive the transition.  Keep an eye on the official site, Relic News, or DOW Planet if what I've said caught your attention.  It's hard not to be excited about it once you've seen it in motion.

You can play Four Swords with four people, three people, two, or one - but, unlike the GBA version that comes with Link To The Past, the experience doesn't change depending on the number of players you have.  So, if you're playing with two people, each person gets two Links that can move in different formations.  It's pretty fun, I doubt that you'll become incontinent with joy while playing it but it's better than a kick in the dick.  It also uses the GBA connectivity in some new ways - any time you fall in a hole or enter a building, basically any time you are not on the overworld adventure map, you enter (or in some cases ""fall into"") the Gameboy.  If you do decide to play it, though, you might as well familiarize yourself with the archetypes. 


While I was detailing the wonders of tradeshows past, I haven't said a lick about what I'm actually playing now.  I'm playing all kinds of stuff.


Bontago:  I have expressed from time to time a fondness for German boardgames.  I can say without reservation that Bontago would be a boardgame inside a computer simulation of Germany.  Imagine what would happen if depraved game scientists sought to make an adversarial version of Jenga, where the height of a given tower was equivalent to its ""influence"" on the space around it, and various powerups for destroying enemy towers were littered about the field of play.  It won the Independent Games Festival's ""Innovation In Game Design"" award, and was (I believe) developed by a student team over at our local DigiPen academy.  You can see games from this and past classes right here, if you'd like.    


Ground Control II:  I'm pretty much in love with this game.  I said just a couple days ago, RTS is not my genre of choice - but this was not always the case.  There was an equilibrium point years ago where the ability of processors to render a certain number of units and my own ability to command those units in meaningful ways intersected.  Also, outside of aesthetic considerations, I don't particularly enjoy building bases, and as much as I like lumber or whatever collecting it isn't exactly my favorite thing.  Oh, and here's something else - units with tons of individual special abilities that must be initiated in real time for them to be useful don't really turn my crank.  These aren't problems with the ""progress"" of the RTS genre so much as they are me trying to make real-time games turn-based.  Manipulating hordes of units and their respective payloads is just as much a part of the game as the tactical elements.


Ground Control 2 is, in a word, fresh.  I don't mean to imply that the experience is new, rather, I mean to evoke the character of old school hip-hop.  The first Ground Control had you moving squads of units and capturing resource collection points, much as in Relic's Dawn of War, but it also had kind of an odd feature - the ability to ""drop in,"" or join dynamically, a live RTS game.  It also had some of the coolest graphics of the time.  You no longer move as squads in the sequel, which is fine actually, but the other two things are still in there...  For the love of God, if you like RTS or are - like myself - something of an apostate as regards the genre, download it.  No base building whatsoever.  No insane hotkeys to remember, every unit simply has two states which offer different functionality and counters to other units.  Excellent graphics, and huge battles you can feel in your gut.  And, like Soldiers: Heroes Of World War II, it offers full cooperative play through the game's main campaign.  I mean, that's it.  Don't gild the lily, guys.  I'm sold.           


I have been playing skirmishes with a friend against the A.I., also known as The Poor Man's Co-Op, and it has a vice-like grip on my scrotum. 


I completed Thief: Deadly Shadows last weekend, which is a pretty long game even on Normal difficulty.  That's good, because it changes the difficulty to normal for you every time to save or move between levels!  Before I heard about the bug, I'd come to think of myself as the paragon of subterfuge.  Thief deserves its own post, and it will get one on Monday.

340,2004-06-14,Manwidth,"When another man questions your throughput, I mean, it's on.  Driving music begins to play and you have to use your crane kick.


As I suggested on Friday, today we will be talking about Thief.  


Eidos chose to call the game Thief: Deadly Shadows for some reason, maybe there's some kind of market research that says casual gamers get scared when they haven't played the earlier games in a series.  Well, that's all well and good, I've finished it and I can tell you the real deal.  There can be no doubt that this is not only a true sequel to the Thief franchise, but is also the last game in a discrete trilogy that bookends the series and even suggests a way forward.  Like Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, it actively services its devoted fans with no regard for the consequences it may suffer at retail. 


I should tell you that it was the PC version that I played through, as I felt going for the Xbox ver would have compromised my principles.  Third person is one thing, I'll get to that in a second.  The Thief series seems emblematic to me of gaming on personal computers, the way it once was - interesting, clever games that appeal to a niche audience.  Also, it helped my decision quite a bit that the big sites would just post one review for the Xbox and PC versions, same text, but the Xbox version would get a lower score.  For someone who purports to discard their assertions outright, I'm terribly beholden to these assessments.    


Thief is the best game I've played this year.  I do believe, having seen everything in there, that the clock was running out by the end and they had to make the best of a bad situation - that, or the publisher was not terribly diligent when examining release candidates.  In addition, the cinemas have an odd, uneven quality that I found a bit jarring, but it hardly made me uninstall the game.  It's just that when you have a game like this, with so much good showing, the half-way stuff really pops.  Properly tuned, I think that Thief belongs with MGS or Splinter Cell as a perfectly valid expression of sneaking gameplay - but it's going to take more than my say so to make a publisher believe that.   


As I suggested on Friday there is a confirmed bug in the A.I., and a patch on the way.  Since most of the games we play as adherents to the medium are animated by completely inane artificial intelligence, it should be emphasized that the way guards and other Unnamed Beings react to their environments could almost be called the entire game.  I'm fairly certain that people who got the game for the Xbox are screwed in this regard.  Games do get ""patched,"" as much as Microsoft might not want to call it that, but those games typically have pronounced online components to begin with.  On the PC, there are some fan-made trainers that are up to the task in the interim.   


I have to be honest, though - I play Thief games for the stories.  Me sneaking around the castle undetected and the guards being hamstrung by their AI routines, I mean, that's pretty much the same thing to me.  It's easy to call this one of the best worlds that is wholly native to videogames, with its steampunk trappings, its warring factions, its odd dialects, and its eminently likable protagonist.  I think there was a fear that Thief III would, with its simultaneous console development, suffer for it - occupying some twilight world somewhere between two finished games.  There's only one facet of the game in which this emerges, and that is with the Zoning in the game - individual missions and even the town hub are fragmented into a number of separate areas to accommodate the memory restrictions on the Xbox, which is really unfortunate for PC users with a half-gig or more of RAM.  I read something somewhere about load times being poor, which is just exacerbated by this problem - I wouldn't know.  I've been running SATA RAID since Uru, and I have no intention of being without it ever again.    


You could call the addition of a third person mode a console concession as well, but I think it's a great addition - particularly if Garrett is going to look this cool.  I mentioned once that the ambient light of a given scene would highlight the edges of the character to keep him visible, and I never got tired of this effect even after marathon 12 hour sessions.  I found myself switching back and forth actually, using both views in concert.  Something else you should know about Thief III:  it has Eric Brosius on audio, which is the same person that did not only the previous games but also System Shock 2, whose audio alone was able to give me a nervous breakdown.  I'm not making a joke, I'll tell you about it sometime if you want - it was horrible.  At any rate, he's at the top of his fucking game.  I used third person to bleed off the tension in a level about three quarters of the way through the game, I don't want to give anything away, so I won't name it.  But let me tell you that I was desperate with terror on more than one occasion, and I could not bear to be in first person mode.  Name the last game where that happened.    


I rarely do this kind of thing, but I really do want to throw my support behind this editor petition.  Sites like Thief Underground and The Circle host fan-made missions for the earlier games, they're essentially mods that - because of the affection gamers have towards the series - have the care and feel of fan fiction.

I'm just afraid that Gabe will learn the wrong lesson from this experience.  He'll come away from it with a fear of shrubs or young men when all that's required is that he be more circumspect regarding his dalliances.  


Has the entire Goddamn universe become snared by the siren song of City of Heroes?  Everywhere I look, monitors glow with bobbing superhero ass.  I played it, and it was great at what it did - Diablo plus Unprecedented Character Creation.  I declared it inoffensive and moved on.  And now, I'd say eighty percent of my friends can't pry themselves from that superteat.


It's freaking me out.  I didn't bite on the initial run because I felt like I wouldn't be missing much, but even Doug - who went to college, and usually doesn't deign to play anything real-time - he's in there punching guys or jumping on buildings or whatever.  Shit, now Scott's in there, may God curse him for a thousand years, and it caused him to crack out some of his best strips.  Now it's like some kind of humor Arms Race.  I need City of Heroes for the raw materials alone. 


I'm just trying to figure out what seized all my friends so, it's literally an epidemic.  Clearly, massaging a unique character out of their generator gives you an enduring impetus to rock villains.  You want this proxy entity to scour the streets with purpose and conviction.  I've seen people play it a lot, I can visit practically any person I know and watch this fucker, and it seems as though quite a few among our number actually play this with their girlfriends.  I know - invigorating.  We rarely receive the imprimatur of our loved ones where games are concerned.  But the combination of a slick interface, a highly custom character, and the fact that even new characters are pretty dangerous just makes it accessible in a way that other genre entries - and indeed, most games - are not.  You can solo and actually enjoy it.  Making supergroups is fun, complete with custom color schemes - but you can group up in other games, that's always been great.  What's a bit different is that the encounters in CoH tend to be versus other groups - not other players, that doesn't come until the expansion - but balanced groups of opponents.  When your crew rushes in, there's actually something really useful for everybody to do, and since there's like six guys over there you feel pretty productive when you lay them out.  There's no crafting, which makes my heart weep - comics are replete with genius inventors of every kind.  I'm strong, though, and I'll find a way to go on.  


Now, see, their new features update is up on the test server, and I'm going to want some high level bad-ass named Al-Hazred or whatever to deal with the influx of evildoers from the City of Villains expansion...  I've got over a hundred people asking for my name and the server I'm sworn to protect...  Also, I have no self control and I repeatedly go back on my word.  I guess I'll see you in there.

Another odd footnote in this Quality of Licensed Games thing, it would appear - even Transformers has been treated with affection!    


We wouldn't believe it, though - not in face of reviews so unchained in their joy as to nearly be songs.  We were even able to endure the positive e-mails sent by readers!  Eventually it was thrown on the GameFly list, but not with care or genuine interest, it was in more of a taunting manner.  Game, I will rent you only when the world sings your praises in unison, and the cost to me is (for all practical purposes) nonexistent.      


I am never at a loss for something to play, between the unstoppable creative torrent of the mod community and the output of a gigantic multinational industry my time is usually spoken for in absolute terms.  So, games I'm enthusiastic about get played, and then games I'm not sure about get played.  A PS2 action game based on a resuscitated license still warm with the memories of a solitary childhood is bound to fall through the cracks, despite my enthusiasm for sentient machines, because Massive games tend to absorb any excess time.


No knowledge of the new shows is required to enjoy this game - you'll know that the Decepticons are the bad guys as soon as they start shooting you for no reason.  We expressed dissatisfaction with the new cartoons cartoon as you might recall, but I will allow that at twenty-six years old I am probably not their target audience.  They're trying to sell robots to children.  They convinced me years ago that I could never have enough Goddamn robots, so their payload has been delivered.  Robot deficiency is one of the central themes of my life.  Mission accomplished, I suppose.


Transformers is just the kind of solid, satisfying game that you hope gets a sequel so they can build on some of the concepts.  Understand this:  where I might abhor the concept of Minicons in a cartoon, where Autobots and Decepticons pantomime the acquisition of toys in a television program already fraught with marketing messages, in a videogame it's absolutely fucking fresh.  So, you have your basic action platformer.  It's using a license you remember liking, so it's kickin'.  All these games make you collect something, in Mario it's Stars, in Banjo Kazooie it's music notes or something.  In this, you collect two things:


Minicons are terribly desirable, and I burn with an unchecked need to obtain them.  Every powerup you would get in another game of this type takes the form of a Minicon in this one - so every weapon, special ability, passive defense, everything is from something you have collected.  And, since you can only slot four of these things, you need to be a bit choosy.  We thought we'd stumbled on a sort of Ultimate configuration recently, leading me to believe that the system was pretty cool but had some loopholes, but then our victory in some huge fights was held up precisely due to our reliance on certain abilities.  


Datacons are essentially special feature unlocks - so, it's things like a new version of the Theme Song, or all the full-motion video in the game featuring the different characters.  On top of that, you have the actual transformation diagrams of several toys that you can run through step by step, or comics you can read right from the menu.  The earth beneath you isn't going to crack and honey isn't going to pour out.  But, there's some neat extras that are actually worth looking at.


The robots in the Transformers game feel as ponderous as they should, while maintaining an organic sensibility - they're heavy equipment and I want that to matter.  Switching into vehicle mode actually gives you a very different feel, they didn't try to gloss over the vehicle controls to make them easier.  There are three Autobots in the initial roster, Optimus, Hot Shot, and Red Alert, who play differently enough to make it an actual choice.  The environments often require the use of vehicle mode for Dukes of Hazzard style jumps, and so taking a ramp, transforming in mid-air over a group of enemies is a beautiful thing that you can cherish frequently.      


There is some slowdown at times, okay, it slows down a lot, but if you saw what it was trying to do you'd probably understand.  Long draw distance coupled with (in some cases) well over thirty enemies, some of which have alternate modes themselves, and everything operated on by some kind of physics calculation.  Physics in games we've sort of some to expect by now, particularly on the PC - they don't really shock me these days unless they accurately simulate something on accident.  Here, where every combatant is actually a sort of living machine, the contortions generated by the physical simulation actually look right.


They even try to communicate the personality of your team in the menu, when they're just sitting there - Red Alert maintaining his weapon, the brash Hot Shot nodding his head to some inaudible beat.  I haven't even begin to discuss some of the massive bosses, and I won't cover them with any specificity.  Honestly, I wish that I could forget so I could see them again without prior knowledge.

346,2004-06-22,Front Mission 4,"
I had some time on Saturday to play a bunch of Front Mission 4. If you take a look at IGN you will see their reviewer gave it a 6.8 while the reader review is a more respectable 8.6. You guys know that we are not in the business of assigning numbers to experiences here at Penny Arcade but if you held a gun to my head I'd have to side with the readers of IGN on this one. I think it's fair to say that Front Mission deserves about a B+.


For me the worst part of the game in the bullshit you have to sit through between trips to the Wanzer shop and the battles. The story is so needlessly complicated and boring that I found myself skipping through the conversations as fast as I could. I watch the occasional cinema in order to get the gist of what's going on in the game, but honestly I just want to get to the fighting. If it wasn't for the convoluted dialogue you have to wade through in order to get to the meat of the game I'd say it was nearly perfect. 


While I played Front Mission on Saturday Kara sat next to me on the couch and played solitaire on the laptop. At one point she commented that every time she looked up I was in the Wanzer customization screen or the pilot upgrade screen. She was honestly curious if I had purchased a new war game or some kind of robot shopping sim.  I have to admit that the interface for upgrading and customizing your units is ponderous at best but it's still probably my favorite part of the game. I can spend thirty minutes just trying to pick the right set of arms for one of my Wanzers and love every second of it. You can spend an hour messing with the various components of your Wanzer and never even get to the fucking weapons. From sniper rifles to giant metal spikes there is no shortage of armaments to choose from.  The payoff to all this setup is watching a Mech you've lovingly customized from the ground up perform exactly as you hoped he would. When the new quicker legs you purchased combine with your pilots upgraded evade skill and your Wanzer ducks a shotgun blast it all feels worth it.


I'm also a big fan of the actual combat in Front Mission. You can unlock bonus missions and other extras by completing certain missions in 15 turns or less but I honestly don't know who that's for. I may just be stupid but I find many of the missions I'm at now taking upwards of 100 turns. I won't try and tell you it isn't frustrating to die on turn 97 but so far I've never been discouraged to the point of wanting to quit the game entirely. Each time I've felt like I understood what I did wrong and I had an idea of how I could refit my Wanzers in order to make better use of them. The IGN review claims that this sort of trial and error is frustrating and that more information about a given level before it started would be helpful. I agree 100%, and that's why I got a copy of the strategy guide. For most of the games I play I just don't think they are necessary, but once I started getting into RPG's and turn based tactical games I found them to be unbelievably helpful. I'm not going to buy a guide for Onimusha 3 that tells me how to get the secret Panda suit, but in a game like Front Mission it's really nice to have a huge chart that shows me all the parts for my Wanzer along with their stats all divided into easy to navigate categories. Throw in tons of great tips, briefings for each level and a completely useless instruction manual and I feel like the strategy guide is a legitimate companion to this sort of game. 


Does the fact that the strategy guide solves some of the problems with Front Mission mean the game isn't any good? I guess it might point towards some poor design decisions. Does that mean you should avoid this title? Well I guess that depends on why you play video games. Personally I play games in order to have fun, not to pick apart their flaws. With a strategy guide I find Front Mission to be extremely fun. The only thing standing between you and hours of tactical bliss is a thin book full of beautiful art. The decision seems easy to me. You're welcome to send me mail and complain that you shouldn't have to buy a guide in order to enjoy a game. I might not reply right away though, since I'll probably be having a good time playing Front Mission.

The first time I saw Ghost - this would have been a couple years ago, now - it was one of the most impressive things available on the floor.  They took a unit from Starcraft, made a character out of it, and let you experience the galactic conflict of that setting as an individual:   dwarfed not only by hulking war technology, but also by the scope and scale of imperial political machinations.  At that time, they were really playing up the stealth/platform angle - and that makes sense.  Ghosts are, as one might infer, covert operatives.    


What we saw at this year's E3 seemed almost unrelated to the game that had so drawn me in initially.  Both the guy demonstrating it (and indeed, the game itself) actively distanced what it was doing from that earlier, stealth based iteration.  The graphics seemed to have taken a turn for the worse.  It didn't make sense.  By now, you've heard what I heard - that Nihilistic is no longer working on the title.  


I've never understood what that relationship consisted of, exactly - the Nihilistic/Blizzard thing.  Initially, we suggested that Blizzard brought them on to help them count all the money.  So, I don't know enough to say whether them being out is a good or a bad thing.  I find the announcement of that fact to be an oddly worded exercise in loose language, but that's neither here nor there.  That Blizzard had a good thing, and then diluted it with a heavier focus on action that didn't feel right and didn't fit the setting - that's really all I care about.  In this June 18th press release, Blizzard submits that it will be using the time between now and release to ""expand and evolve"" the game's design - although whether that means they're going back to a more authentic Ghost experience or hurtling farther forward into overt violence I couldn't tell you.    


Stealth games are sort of epitomized by Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, to be sure - hojillion dollar budgets and taut universes dense with political peril.  Playing Thief recently made me realize just how much wider and more enjoyable that field could be if it could, in the manner of a healthy genre, entertain more geographically and chronologically disparate locales.  If Blizzard thinks they've got a good thing going with this new motif, fine - perhaps what I saw was some half-dressed transition state.  I just think there's room for them at the upper echelons of tactical stealth, with their delicious art and their tattered star systems.  Of course, they should know that too - they're the ones that made me believe it.

Also in case you missed it. Our World of Warcraft contest ends this Friday. We have a number of beta accounts to give away. Here is Tycho’s post from last week with all the details:



I'm sorry, but they made it clear to us that only Night Elves could get these beta slots.  All you need to do is send us proof of your elfin heritage, we'll give you an account, and you'll be on your way.  Pictures of you as a baby, the song your mom used to sing you, a home movie, mystical recipes, just about anything that establishes your place among your people is fine.  Contest goes until next Friday - that is to say, the 25th of June.  Please send all contest entries to wowcontest@penny-arcade.com .  Don't send them to my personal account.  If you send them to my personal account, not only will you not win, I will kill you.  



We will announce the winners on Monday the 28th.

Credit exchanges for Massive games are inimitably useful mechanisms - the notion behind them seems counterintuitive, and we've certainly enjoyed some amusement at their expense.  But - if you're a person that thinks of your own time as the prime currency and the various manifestations and products of that time as inherently fungible, it makes a lot of sense to resort to brokers of strange currencies.  If somebody takes advantage of your exchange itself, though - if they purposefully manipulate the intangibility of the product you sell - it must be a pain explaining to normal people exactly what it is you do.     


I've been looking forward to Mario Golf: Advance Tour for quite a while, in large part because we've got a number of airline flights coming up and I need something to think about besides my untimely demise.  It also uses Nintendo's Wireless Adapter, which I don't own, but it's nice to feel that I'm halfway there.      


The way clubs connect with balls is virtually identical to Toadstool Tour on the Cube, which I enjoyed quite a lot, outside of the occasionally odd ball physics.  For the longest time I was content to blame myself for these inversions of sensible behavior, blaming myself for the faults of others being a passtime I cleave to with great enthusiasm.  At any rate, just as in the sometimes inexplicable Cube version you have your choice of automatic and manual shots, complete with power variations and various spin options.  Putting is a little less ornate, but it's fine.            


You have probably heard that the game uses a sort of RPG metaphor, which I was initially very excited about.  Look at the Super Mario role-playing games for a hint at why - viewing the acknowledged structures of that genre through the template of the ridiculous, fungus-obsessed Mario context was (and is) illuminating.  I have kind of a fetish where transposition is concerned, so it's possible that the game simply strokes some personal nub.  It does set my mind to spinning, though, envisioning the contours of the golf/role-playing nexus.        


The game's by Camelot, so you will be struck initially by the similarities to Golden Sun - but I really must say the RPG ""story"" mode doesn't turn my crank.  It's really two separate games, like one genre with another genre perched atop its head.  In practice, it is an exhausting, serpentine menu system which obscures actual play.  You level up, and you talk to boring girls in iteration X of Japanese Exposition Theater.  I don't care, and if I wasn't desperate for alternate versions of the courses I'd simply forget about it altogether.  Luckily, while the game starts out with an almost unbearable about of inane dialogue, that hasn't been my experience farther in.   


Even without indulging in that mode, though, there's plenty of game available at the outset for people without the stamina to endure mundane exercises - and the play is very satisfying.  To use more than one GBA you're all going to need cartridges, which is unfortunate - but you can also play multi modes just by passing the device around, and that works fine.  There's a healthy selection of these modes, as well: Stroke, Match, competitive and co-operative Doubles, Skins, a mode called Club Slots which randomly determines your equipment, as well as a Near-Pin challenge that makes for a quick competitive round.  There's another one, called Go-Go Gates, which is this version's ""Ring Attack"" but feels like a combination of Golf and Croquet.            


I guess it speaks well of the game that I can discard half of it and still be satisfied, but that's pretty much what we're talking about.  The Golfing portions of this Golf game are excellent, and belong in your pocket.

We sent an invitation to PAX to the editor of a fancy videogame magazine. We thought it was a nice thing to do. He responded saying that there were events like ours all the time and he couldn't make it. It was just another Lan party in his eyes and not worth his time. 


Saying PAX is just a Lan party is like saying Woodstock was just a concert. I’m not claiming it will be the defining moment for a generation of gamers but it’s certainly going to something special.


Like Tycho said, we are going to present the greatest geek music concert ever. From hard core geek rock and rap to a fucking piano concert full of Final Fantasy music. There has never been a show like this before.


We have a Lan room that’s true, but we also have a console room with over thirty televisions and a tabletop room for miniature games and CCGs.  No matter what kind of games you like you’ll find something to play at PAX.


We have an exhibition room that will be full of game developers showing off their upcoming games. We are just putting the final touches on the list of titles you’ll be able to see and play at PAX. I can tell you it’s gonna knock you on your ass. You don’t get to see shit like this unless you sneak into E3.


We will have panels with industry professionals. They will be talking about everything from breaking into the industry to the current state of online games. You’ll even be able to pitch your own game ideas to the guys that decide what games make it and what games don’t. 


As if all that wasn’t enough we will also be holding the Omegathon. It’s essentially a two day gaming tournament held in the style of a reality TV show. Players will get kicked out each round until the final two will compete for the ultimate prize. Somebody who attends PAX is going to walk away with a video game collection that is now worth close to $30,000.


No one has every attempted a convention like this. If we’re able to pull it off (and I think we can) it’s going to be incredible. Sorry about the rant. PAX is super important to us and I’m just really excited about it. 


I also wanted to direct you towards the west coast super trip again. If you plan on coming to PAX, and you live on this side of the country the west coast super trip sounds like a blast.


on a side note, be sure and use the mail link at the bottom of my posts if you want to reach me. The old address is still fucked up.

As is established every time an entry in this genre is released, Gabriel actually played Golf in high school and has retained this coarse habit even to the present day.  And, by luring me onto an actual course with tales of high powered carts and mobile refreshment stands, he drew me into his dark world.  You've seen his twisted interpretation of my own passtime, but starting today, we will dip into his perverted cesspool for a series of undetermined length.      


Speaking of my cohort, I was trying to explain to him what it was about City of Heroes that had seized me so suddenly.  I'm as surprised as anyone.  Indeed, I felt sure that after my beta experience I had - in effect - made my saving throw and would suffer no ill effects from the exposure.  There were simply some things that I did not understand in fullness when I played it initially.  I knew that it was good, and was perhaps even great - but with more than thirty hours beneath my belt now it's something that I have a bit more appreciation for.    


City of Villains, the expansion due out in 2005, is supposed to incorporate some kind of crafting along with lair building and raiding and whatever else.  Details on it are pretty loose.  I'm always talking about crafting, and so it's possible you have come to the conclusion that I think it is the most important part of massive role-playing games.  That's not incorrect, actually.  I would need to remove a shoe in order to enumerate the times I've chosen crafting over my own wife. 


There is something like crafting in the game, though - building of a sort - which satisfies whatever that odd need of mine is.  You can't make things like you could in other games, physical objects that could be passed around, because you don't actually have an inventory to speak of.  Obviously, City of Heroes players already know that - but there is no area where physical objects accrue.  As you go about your noble task, upon defeating a foe you will sometimes just get one of two things, either Inspirations or Enhancements.


Inspirations are essentially like one-shot powerups that function for a specified amount of time: improve accuracy, regenerate health, do more damage, whatever.  As you level up, you're able to carry more of these at once.  Unlike other games, where you might reserve powerups of this kind for some theoretical future scenario, you don't really feel that bad using them in CoH because you get them all the Goddamn time.  It would be likely jealously guarding each individual Skittle in the Party Size Bag.  For all practical purposes, the number of Skittles is infinite.  You might not always have the color you want, but it seems petty to retain them.


Enhancements are where the Crafting Lite comes in.  You already know that there's no inventory, but since it's a game about heroes you can presume that you have powers of some kind.  Well, these powers are pretty much all you have.  You draw them from a primary and secondary tree, new ones become available as you level up, and there's a more general pool available to everybody once you level up a bit.  Each of these abilities starts with a single slot you can use to modify or ""enhance"" your power - I'm sure you know what's coming next.  It may change later, I'm not qualified to talk about high-level play yet - but on odd numbered levels you don't get new powers as such, you get new enhancement slots which you can apply to your existing powers.  You get Enhancements for those slots in the same way you get Inspirations - you don't actually pick them up or anything, they're just sort of ""obtained"" once you defeat a whirring clockwork automaton or something.  These enhancements come in a variety of different forms - increase damage, increase healing, increase slow duration, increase accuracy, things of this sort.  Of course, you can't increase the damage of your healing ability - not every enhancement works for every power, and so they'll get traded to other players or sold if you can't use them.   


I play one of their strange takes on the healing class called a Dark Defender.  He doesn't heal your own people so much as he hurts other people and the party benefits.  In order to aid people, I need to have enemies around, and I need to make a successful attack - so it's not always the sort of thing you can count on.  With the enhancement system, I can mitigate that somewhat.  The way it's set up currently is that I have invested four of my enhancement slots in Twilight Grasp, which is the ornate title they've given that power.  That makes for a total of five slots, in which I have placed an Enhancement that reduces its recharge time, as well as two slots each for accuracy and healing bonuses.  Eventually, there are types of enhancements that cater to specific character types - but you can figure that stuff out for yourself if you decide to play.  All I'm saying is that customizing my powers is somehow able to quiet my strange urge.    


The other thing that I didn't understand is the extent to which playing with different groups reveals really crucial interdependencies.  I'll talk about that some other time, but the more I play, the more I think that ""teaming"" is actually the purpose of their entire game.

I rarely have nice things to say regarding continuity, using modifiers such as ""dreaded"" or ""despicable"" to characterize it.  Aside from our general aversion to the concept, which - as we've established - is really quite vile indeed, it's simply not compatible with the way we do things around here.  Certainly, we can envision a series of sequential events and transcribe them.  However, the moment we commit to something of that nature, invariably something entertaining or revolting occurs and we're forced to make a decision between maintaining some artificial scenario we've invented or covering the events of the industry in real time.   


Gabriel is leaving us next week for his annual family get-together, the strip and post will continue as usual, and the storyline we hinted at yesterday will begin on Monday - in the meantime, we couldn't let these Driv3r review rumors we saw linked off of Evil Avatar just slip by.  I'm not saying that they're true, now - I'm saying that I hope they are.  Because God damn if I'm not ready to sell out.  I'm right here.  This is the kind of shit I can bring, game industry.  I'm talking about some graphic homoerotic metaphors.  You know where to find me.       


It has been a long time since I wrote anything substantial about a movie.  I believe the last time I experimented with the form was in an off the cuff dismissal of Requiem For a Dream, which tickled neither my fancy nor any other part, but my skull still reverberates with the bludgeoning I received from film school students and drama queens for whom Aronofsky's ridiculous After-School Special glittered with secret meaning.  Luckily, though that great gulf yawned between us, I managed to find a sliver of common ground with that film's adherents:  Jennifer Connelly is hot to death.  Staring intently into a mirror, I once said her name for an hour in the hopes that she would suddenly appear.     


I had an opportunity to see Spider-Man 2 at midnight, which is a tradition among our people as you well know.  The tickets were purchased via some ordinary online mechanism,  common, which seems anticlimactic compared to the tent cities that blossomed around the Episode One line - but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.  I've had the archetypical line experience, I can relate cautionary tales to the young if necessary.    


The second Spider-Man movie is, in essence, radical.  They really have the right idea, a pattern which the X-Men films also deliver on:  make a movie that is great on its own, for anyone, but is heavily encrusted with references for the faithful - some overt, some nearly subliminal in their delivery.  The possible follow-up is made quite prominent, but they have planted the seeds of Spider-Men Three through Five while holding in a real way to what makes the character so great:  how human he is.  Even Brenna, who in most cases can be trusted to patiently yield to my fascination with films of this type, has actively sought out information on this movie and solicited assurances from me regarding our attendance.  It's easy to see why - there is a real disparity between the invulnerable, mythological ""hero"" and this young man named Peter Parker who is beaten virtually to death in every encounter.  His risks seem genuine in a way that the exploits of paranormal bad-asses typically don't.

You're probably aware that Interplay wasn't paying it's employees, which culminated in the state of California telling Interplay they could go fuck themselves.  Now me, I always assumed that this was the precursor to an intellectual property fire sale that would hopefully get things like Fallout into good hands.  It's not that I think that putting powerful franchises on the auction block automatically leads to some omnibenevolent result.  However, in Thief: Deadly Shadows, we have a recent example of how the passionate people that breathed life into a setting can, in some reconstituted form, deliver the impossible.     


Anyway, reading Interplay's press release it's easy to picture them writing their optimistic missive from the bottom of a dark well.  The document makes it seems like they're trying to ride a massively multiplayer Fallout game out of debt, they'll hitch it up to us and we'll pull them out.  I don't have an opinion on their nonexistent Fallout MMO, there's nothing to know.  I do take issue with them swinging that license around like the solution to all their problems.  I've heard things are finally looking up for them, though - they've begun hiring organisms they can pay only in garbage. 


There's an interesting UT2k4 mod called Clone Bandits that I downloaded end of last week, only there wasn't a single server out there for me to play it on so it never came up in the post.  It's a damn shame, too - I've spent a lot of time by myself in the map, lonely, wondering how things would play out with a few humans in there to manufacture new values for x.  Visually, it's a sort of Mad Max/Fallout hybrid, with a striking, ironic design that seems to imply that today's brands are so tenacious they can endure even nuclear holocaust - I mean, go look at it.


It could not evoke those themes without vehicles, and they have three completely custom rides to choose from - the Barracuda, an all purpose, refurbished battle wagon, the MosCowboy, a missile with wheels attached to form a nominal motorcycle, and the Lounge Tank, a weapons platform slash full patio deck.  The gameplay is a variation on CTF which involves the hinted at clone banditry.  Imagine the ""ticket"" based gameplay of Battlefield, except the focus isn't just on destroying enemies - you literally steal the spawns from the other team, you can even build pumps to do this at a constant rate.  Only one map that I know of, but it looks great - there's even a cool soundtrack that further cements their nostalgic future context.  It's just a very professional package all around.

As we had established, the full investigation into the crevices of Gabriel's strange amusements has begun. 


I have knowledge of what is going on in gaming, my diet consists largely of news sites and weak coffee.  To say that I don't give a fuck about it is impolite but it's the most unambiguous way of putting it.  This editorial space will one day become saturated with City of Heroes banter, assuming this state has not already been achieved, but if what I do here is discuss things that are of interest to me then there is currently no subject which produces greater enthusiasm.   


Could it possibly have been launched at a better time?  Certainly, the game is amusing.  I might even go so far as to say that it is very good.  Between world of Warcraft's extended beta, though, and the fact that id and Valve can finish a game whenever they feel like it, City of Heroes was able to pierce the crust of the Earth and implant a world devouring embryo.  


This is my idea of a good time, though certainly your mileage may vary:  reading other people's secret origins.  It's not hard to do, just right click on any character and select ""info.""  People tend to congregate where they can level up, which happens in city centers - there might be forty or fifty people there standing around a boombox while you pry into their mysteries.  The screen where you type your character's name initially is a sort of Superhero Identification card, with a place right on there for your needlessly elaborate backstory.  Some people write them in character, as though they are being asked in an interview by a local reporter.  Some people simply type ""W,"" which isn't particularly illuminating.  I've been surprised at how many people have actually taken advantage of that space.  It does seem to imply that your condition has reached a somewhat advanced stage.  


Their latest content drop added something that can be used for an interesting purpose - alternate costumes at levels 20, 30, and 40.  Certainly, it's nice to have them.  Making characters is still one of the best things about the game.  What this allows you to do, though, if you're already a social outcast and don't mind discarding any hope for a normal life, is to create a sort of story arc for your character that these three alternate costumes represent.  Just to give an example, the courageous DocBot I mentioned once before has - through his continued selfless service - honed his empathic subroutines and begun to take on a more human appearance.  Now, you're apparently limited to your current body type and gender, which I think is unfortunate even though I understand why do that.  Certainly, Cryptic Studios doesn't want to deal with e-mails from parents asking them why they've allowed their child to play heroic transvestites or  pre- and post-operative super transsexuals.  At the same time, they could allow characters to swap sizes in such a way as to create mild-mannered alter-egos for their characters, or generate Bruce Banner/Hulk-type dualities.          


This will only last a couple days, I'm sure - this unremitting fascination - after which, you won't be made to endure this sort of thing.  I play a lot of videogames, though, so when I am gripped with such anaconda strength it's probably something to make a note of.  With Gabe out of town this week, I'm in a position to take this game very seriously.

Breathtaking revelations regarding the Sport of Kings come to light. 


Yesterday, Pork and myself were able to winnow down the WoW Beta entries from around three thousand to around one-fifty.  When Gabe and I submitted the concept of this contest to you, it seemed pretty accommodating as far as what you could do to enter it.  Convince us of your mystical parentage, and bam - welcome to Beta Town.  And, just as I'd hoped, there really were a variety of different entries.  Yes, we had the baby pictures, recipes, driver's licenses, and other things you would expect.  We also had pictures of a greasy man emerging from a shower, whose teeth looked as though they'd been cobbled together at random from neighborhood strays.  We got a lot of things.


Point is, I thought that our submission receiving aperture was as wide as possible.  However, as we read through them, I quickly discovered that while the contest itself was apparently accommodating there was a sort of shadow rule structure, one I was not previously aware of, that also governed the proceedings.  This one I knew more by instinct, I had but to look at an entry and its infractions were plain to me.  What follows is something of a revised rule system, which, now that the submission phase is over, really doesn't do you any good.


Dark Elves are not Night Elves.  Nor are High Elves, ewoks, or pirates.  Spock is not a night elf.  Lucky from the Lucky Charms box is not a Night Elf.  Mr. T is not a Night Elf.  Yoda is an alien, from an utterly different continuity.  I'll get back to you continuity people in a second.  In the meantime, Jesus Christ and Michael Jackson are not Night Elves.  Under absolutely no circumstances is Neo from The Matrix a Night Elf.     


Bag End isn't in Azeroth, Felblade Darkhand.  And even if it were, fucking elves don't live there.


If you would like to win our World of Warcraft specific contest, do not for any reason refer to other continuities.  Certainly, other worlds are nice.  But when I ask you to prove you're a Night Elf, and then you send me a picture of your fucking Trandoshan entertainer?  What the fuck is that?  No Tolkien references.  Don't make up other kinds of elves for you to be, because this contest is judged only on how well you comport to the specific characteristics of a particular fantasy race!  Don't tell me what year you are, or what Hogwarts house the sorting hat put you in.  I delete that shit.  Check this one out: 


""My material lineage is of the McLeod clan, known best for being the Highlander's own clan.""


When I read something like that, it makes the back and front parts of my brain want to touch themselves together.  It is like come kind of code that, when comprehended, unfolds into madness in the mind of the reader.      


Sometimes they start so good!  I'm not so self-conscious that I can't be transported to Azeroth on occasion, and so when I see something like this:   


""Below is a Night Elf pre-battle chant that my parents
taught to me many years ago when the Horde first
entered our sacred lands.  Today we sing it everytime
before we go off into battle!""


I'm like, yeah!  I'm ready to fight the Orcs!  Then they follow it up with:  


""(Sung to Paula Cole's ""Where Have All the Cowboys
Gone"")""


And I'm like, no, sweetheart!  You were doing so good.

The behaviors that result from a combination of their mobile refreshment stands and carts is so obvious, so naturally arrived at that it must be their intention.  We can assume we have the imprimatur of the clubhouse when we drive with our eyes closed, or cut straight across the fairway because we think we saw a ""cool bird.""   


After doing my first Task Force, Task Forces being a kind of hard core marathon of crime interdiction that takes several consecutive hours, my City of Heroes fixation became something more than an anecdote I could relate.  I would imagine it is something like when gin has finally bored a hole through an alcoholic's esophagus, so that the next time they tip up their cup it just flows out their neck and gets on their shirt.  I needed games I could apply directly to the source of pain, and I've found one that has managed to curb the cravings to a certain extent.


I've been playing Missing, which is sometimes subtitled ""Missing: Since January.""  I'd seen this game at E3 actually, wandering through the Adventure Company booth after checking out Guilty Gear Isuka.  The guys who were demoing it seemed lonely, and I always feel for these people anyway so I initially feigned an interest which would become genuine almost immediately.  Here's the hook, essentially - two people went missing, oddly enough, while unraveling a series of murders.  One of these guys is an investigative journalist, and so when his company receives a CD from the killer - complete with odd fragments of the journalist's own footage - they determine that it's a little more than they can handle.  They open it up to anyone who wants to try and figure out this nutjob's crazy CD, and maybe track down our two lost souls.  Once you sign up, your paired with other people into a sort of ""team"" - these other ""people"" being scripts on a webserver somewhere, but I'm honestly not sure sometimes.  This team of yours communicates with you via actual e-mail, amounting to a tip dispensing mechanism should you require it, but also just progresses the plot outside of the CD-ROM itself.  


The puzzles in the game usually aren't always puzzles in the Myst tradition, and often involve using Google to research information which is sometimes legitimate and sometimes has the trappings of legitimacy but is actually a website created out of whole cloth for the game.  Already, you're beginning to draw parallels between this game and Majestic, the ill-fated conspiracy game slash social experiment.  Unlike Majestic, this game doesn't fax or call you, and there's certainly no monthly fee to play it.  The mails are interesting and relevant, and can even be replied to, which made the hair on the back of my neck twitch.  


The thing that sucks is that, yes - they have this great thing that smudges the line between the game and the larger Internet.  There are false web pages out there that you dig through and correlate, tons of writing when into these portions of the game.  But since you are searching the real Internet, every time I try to play the game right, links to FAQs with all the information on puzzle solutions are right there in the link description, along with the planted websites.  I guess I'm not sure what they could do about that, but I do envy those people who played the game first.  Being able to search the real Internet, as opposed to some database on the disc, and getting mails to real accounts, as opposed to some proprietary program - those are the elements that really get ahold of you at times, so it's been something I've made my peace with.


The new WoW beta patch has a couple features I've been agitating for - auction houses, to get right down to it - but a man needs to be careful treating his MMO related condition with another Massive game.  Thirteen readers who entered the contest will know exactly what I mean when they win next week - we're heading down to Texas this weekend, but I want Gabe to get a chance to see the last batch of entries when he comes back.  Look for the exciting conclusion next week, I'm going to say sometimes Wednesday.

The final act of our indefensible alliance with continuity has been uploaded for your perusal.  Before Sunday's Guildhall event, we got up at fuck o'clock to play golf here.  It's pretty much official, the sport stuck.  If I have the compulsion to do something even two times, that's not just enthusiasm - it's virtually tradition.  


This part of Texas is - contrary to virtually every broadcasted image - populated almost entirely by actual human beings as opposed to ridiculous caricatures with ostentatious belt buckles.  We did see one cowboy hat, without which we might not have felt we were engaging in an authentic experience, but outside of that capacious chapeau Texan icons were few and far between.  Also, Texas is the hottest place on the fucking Earth.  The pavement radiates heat even at one o'clock in the morning when you are walking to the grocery store because you are starving.  I was thinking about how young people might appreciate this phenomenon when a cyclone of cockroaches devoured my legs down to the femur.     


Our question and answer thing ran about two hours with a break in the middle, and there were a few good ones this time out.  The one that really stuck out to me concerned how we're portrayed by other comic strips, as either impenetrably aloof, immeasurably wealthy, or simply as hostile psychopaths.  We are, it would seem, wholly alien to this world and have no right to nor role in its natural ecosystem.  The answer included comments from both myself as well as my recently returned accomplice, but to touch on probably the most important point, it's actually not so long ago that we were (in our righteous campaign) trying to start shit with fellow webcomic User Friendly, whose only crime was being more popular than we were.  We were edgy, you understand, very edgy indeed, and we were assholes of the worst sort, a reality which was well established before any general enthusiasm for our work or even before the emergence of the consumer Internet.  So, the notion that young comics need to denigrate what we do here - by the very methods we ourselves employed, in their position - I mean, I guess I don't really care about that.  That doesn't even merit the Alanis Morissete School of Irony.  The fact remains that it is my job to play videogames with my best friend.  And my wife is hot. 


You can attract our stern attention, it is possible, but I do have to warn you that you probably won't care about your imagined feud with us once you do it.  How about you toil for years on your comic, doing the best work you can, until by some combination of reader largesse or business acumen you're able to live completely on the proceeds from your creative output.  Then, set aside money and time for charitable acts like scholarships and toy drives.  Man, that'd really burn me up.  Boy.


The night at Gameworks (set up by the inestimable ElderCat) satisfied me in all respects, although clearly, Joey's hypnotic extemporaneous stylings or Matthew's admirable personal investment in the written word would have been themselves reason enough to visit.  I think that Kansas City may have better barbecue, Texas, but they don't have the sweltering, molten heat that subdues human intellect.  So, you guys each have something.

It's amazing the things you can find at junk sales.


Feel free to digest this interview with the executive producer, but chances are good you know about the new Fallout game, developed and published by Morrowind's Bethesda Softworks.  Understand that this does not refer to Interplay's previously floated Fallout MMO thing - we might not know anything significant until E3, significant as in ""is it turn-based"" or ""is it first person.""  This paucity of genuine data lends itself to wild speculation, but we can look at Morrowind and say that non-linear gameplay is their bag, or if not their bag itself, we can feel confident that it is at least stored in a bag of some kind.         


For the same reason that I can muster enthusiasm for Half-Life 2 though I know fuck all regarding anything about it, Fallout 3 can receive the same treatment, and for the same reason - I have faith that, like Morrowind, potent content creation tools will come along with, or shortly thereafter.  There is always (to my mind) a sort of challenge implicit in distributing the suite involved in creating a game, and I want desperately to know who would rise to the occasion and precisely what would result from it.  Could the High Council of Fallout Forum Purists deliver the sequel they always dreamed of?  I'm curious.  


As far as whether or not I think the glory days of Fallout are back, would ever be back, that is not something I expect out of this new series - and that's not an insult. The original games strike me as such oddities that I have a hard time believing they ever existed, even in retrospect.  I think of Fallout as a wonderful accident of history, not some endlessly refreshed fountain, I don't believe that The Fallout Spirit projects from some eternal, unsullied coordinate in the heart of man.  The SPECIAL system, that old warhorse, and the post apocalyptic yet somehow naive world they baked at Black Isle is to me emblematic of a different age of PC game development, epitomized in Planescape - and it's no coincidence that both of these games emerged from the same development house.    


Action RPGs took the day at the last E3, just as stylish, ersatz Dantes percolated an entire generation of leaping action stars the year prior.  When I played Fallout, and its inheritor, initiating combat and managing my inventory, did I enjoy it enough?  Did I enjoy it as though the preconditions for such entertainments were disappearing?  There was something precious and indiosyncratic about PC roleplaying games that I do not currently detect.  We scions of that heritage are aware of the void.

And that's just one game, in one publishers booth. The rest of the list will be up soon and it will have all the other game companies and what they will be showing off. I promise you're going to flip out when you see the shit we have lined up for you. For right now I thought I'd let you guys salivate over this one for a little while. 


I'd also like to mention that Brady games will be at PAX showing off some of their collector's edition art books and strategy guides. They will also be passing out 2000 Soul Calibur 2 guides to PAX attendees.


So right now my guess is you are desperately trying to figure out how to get to Seattle this August 28&29. Well, might I suggest the West Coast Supertrip? If a huge caravan of dorks working there way across the west coast like some kind of giant moving LAN party with satellite internet access sounds like a good time to you, then check the site or hit up the forum thread located here.

Gabriel has a unique...  ""relationship"" I guess you would call it with a certain Spider-man.  I'm just saying it's a touchy subject.  So, if for example you are Kirsten Dunst, who plays Mary Jane, and you let fly in some interview that you think Spider-Man should die and and be replaced by the bulbous ""spider-baby"" fruit of your mutant union, it's not going to go over well.  


Being one of the people that actually bought into the whole Uru Live concept, I grabbed Uru: Path Of The Shell on Tuesday and prepared to lament the loss of their strange, multiplayer puzzle universe.  For those of you that don't know what I mean or believed something else about it, there was to be an ongoing series of premium content drops you could get as a subscriber to Uru Live, and the puzzles themselves allowed for multiple people to be in them and work together in what we'd think of as a series of ""instanced"" worlds.  As I've asserted on numerous occasions, I'm prepared for episodic content.  So, while Uru made severe missteps with their adoption of third-person, platform bullshit which has no place in their game, the rest of it - the odd, beautiful worlds, the intimate journals, and the idea that I could visit quirky new realms at interval seized me.    


So when they cancelled it, either due to technical problems, lack of sufficient consumer interest, or some amalgam thereof, it was a blow but I was happy to focus on the very significant single player portion, especially since there would be one free expansion - To D'ni - and one pay expansion, at least that we knew of, called The Path Of The Shell.  I will admit to you now that I bought their world one-hundred percent.  I said once in some post that I don't try to dismantle and analyze the games I play, at least not while I'm actively engaged in them.  That's simply not the way I do it, though I have friends who incorporate those methods.  With Myst, I'm almost ashamed to tell you how completely consumed I was.  When I was down in Tejas, I enunciated this concept more fully:  essentially, I am a willing participant in the simulation and I have an investment in its ability to produce amusement.  I want it to work.   


To make a long story short, after installing Path Of The Shell the game takes so long to start I assumed it had crashed.  All of my work from the first game was lost.  If I had a more intellectual, analytical approach to this kind of thing, this wouldn't be such a big deal.  I would go and read the threads where people first discovered there might be an issue, maybe try to track down some kind of FAQ, try to see if maybe some industrious fan had done the work of the developer again and tried to cook up an unauthorized patch.  That's if I had a more intellectual, analytical approach.      


That's the trouble with my method.  It allows for a sort of electronic communion, that's true enough.  But the careless transposition of some mathematically inconsequential variable had the effect of wiping out not my data, but negating my entire experience from the first game.  Entering my customizable private age, or Relto - Jesus, I can't even describe this without using their made up, nonsense words - going into this place I had tailored to my specifications, all the evidence of my noble activities had been eradicated.  Instead of losing my save and getting mad, their intricate universe had put me into this sort of trance where I felt genuine longing.

With Doom 3's precise ship date in hand, now is the time to lavish affection on our machines - or the machines of others, when your console gaming friends suddenly remember that they own a computer.  They'll slum down here with us for the major releases, sure - but they secretly wish they were jumping on mushrooms, or one of the other surreal fantasies they indulge in.        


id Software, who made their reputation releasing the first levels of their games as an advertisement for the rest, won't be dropping a demo of any kind until after the retail release.  The multiplayer tests for Quakes II and III served a technical purpose, that's true, but being able to see what id's mad wizard was capable of at each iteration was always thrilling - and just as we'd always been able to, we could taste and see (as it were) the complex fruit they had produced.  Not this time apparently, which is unfortunate, because it's more needed than ever. 


I say it's more important because I have a feeling that this game is going to beat the shit out of people's computers.  That's always been the case, to a certain extent, where PC gaming is involved - you wanted MMX for Unreal (Pentium 233), desperately needed glQuake (3dfx), this game has sounds (Soundblaster, AdLib, MIDI), etcetera.  The arms race metaphor is apt.  But now that nVidia and ATI have divvied up the PC into two gaming platforms, branding individual games, or in the case of Valve coming right out and saying that the competitor's product performs miserably in Half-Life 2, it fills me with trepidation to think about upgrading without a dependable performance target on my machine to bench against.  I don't mean the Recommended System, which you could not in good conscience recommend to anyone.  Some kind of pre-release code, anything would help.     


We haven't had polite things to say regarding their upside-down devil heads, or their other monsters, salvaged as they were from discarded junior high peechees.  That said, I've never considered a reality where I did not obtain the game the moment it was released at retail.  Isn't that something.  I'm opposed to it on virtually every level, and it's still got that hook in my mouth, in my gums - hauling me to some unidentified retail outlet.

366,2004-07-21,The Wandering Age: Last Rites,"
This is the current plan, don't hold me to it - we've got a CTS: Wandering Age comic up today, called Last Rites.  You'll know what happened when you read it.  Now, it has become tradition that we upload a sketch of some sort on days where we are gallavanting far from home.  Hopefully you enjoy that sort of thing, but let's be clear - they are fun for us to do, but I'm not above admitting there is a certain pragmatism to the format.    


It is our intention to use the days allotted for sketching - that is to say, Friday and Monday - to relate the events just before today's strip, as loose recollections.  It seems like that might be a way to use the sketch concept in a fashion will that will be more than simply servicable.  Of course, maybe we'll get bored of it or someone will do something stupid, and we'll be forced to catalogue it.  We are going to the San Diego Comic-Con, after all.  The odds of a man doing something shameful are really quite high.    


I do not customarily wave a pair of pom-poms and engage in rah-rah Webcomic Boosterism, which along with our unwarranted success tends to preclude our involvement in community reindeer games.  However!  I'm fairly certain that cartoonists who work on the web pretty much run the show at the San Diego Comic-Con.  Coalitions like Dumbrella go in together for a booth, and I'll be Goddamned if I can even get in there to talk to those guys sometimes.  The Keenspot table resembles a kind of mothership, which sorties of fresh faced cartoonists depart from on all manner of subversive missions.  Look at Piro's line if you want to see something extraordinary - you'd think someone had discovered precious metals over there.  The line For Penny Arcade is sometimes comparable to the lines of genuinely famous people, like Mark Waid, who is actually brilliant.  That we are able to garner such enthusiasm doesn't bode well for the prospect of a universal justice.  


To add another layer of complexity to the already Escher-level contortions of our relationship, Scott Kurtz has invited us to some kind of panel on Sunday, from 3-4 in the nebulous ""Room 2.""  Hopefully that is enough of a descriptor, I have no idea where that shit is.  Scott, his penchant for drama in perfect working order, has entitled the panel ""Is Newspaper Syndication Dead: The Future of the American Comic strip.""  We'll be up there with Michael Jantze of The Norm, as well as Kris Straub from Checkerboard Nightmare, who I wanted to meet anyway so I guess this makes it easy.  At absolutely any other time, we will be at our booth - number 1714 - should you get lonely.        


Before I go, there's a great article about the state of the PC games industry here at JoeUser dot com.  The poster goes by the handle Draginol, but I have every reason to believe that he would also answer to ""Brad Wardell"" if pressed - Brad Wardell being the Stardock guy, who I praised not only for his excellent Galactic Civilizations but also the painless manner in which I was able to acquire it electronically.  Apparently, he wasn't finished usurping the retail channel.    


Because I wanted access to Stardock's beta software, specifically The Political Machine, I subscribed to a service they used to call Drengin dot net which allowed access to all of their games for the duration of your subscription.  That concept has been updated somewhat to include games from other publishers as well, all distributed and maintained via a single host application, in a service called Total Gaming dot net.  Apparently my old subscription transferred over, because I've got access to Celtic Kings and the complete edition of Disciples II with all the expansions in addition to the stuff I'd originally meant to buy.  I'll be curious to see what other developers cotton to his way of doing things.  


You read his article, and he says a lot of the things I've said about how problematic and insulting being a PC gamer can be.  The difference is that, in response, he went on to revolutionize publishing.  I had a sandwich.  I guess that's the difference between us.

The somewhat elaborate Cardboard Tube Samurai adventure that we wrote is, if not impossible, certainly improbable from the laptop - unfortunately, this took hours to figure out.  It's something that we'll do properly on Wednesday and Friday - for the time being, here are our two offerings as a conciliatory gesture.  It turns out that my hotel does have Internet, and it's free, even - but that support is extremely porous.  Indeed, it only appears to function properly in a five by five area, easily discernable by the dog pile of geeks all trying to get five bars of wireless signal.  


Some details might be in order, though - for example, before this convention, I was not aware that there was a person - Rob Liefeld - who was famous simply for sucking to a great degree.  By that calculation, I should be famous for the hundreds of things I'm miserable at.  Also, mothers continue to bring their young children to us for sketches when they have absolutely no idea what it is we do, and when they say he can draw whatever he wants, he invariably draws the Fruit Fucker. This doesn't really work out that well for us.  When he draws the Fucker itself, everything is okay - it's just kind of an odd robot, his protrusion on the front need not necessarily be a steel phallus.  When he adds the ravaged fruit and the accompanying puddle of juice, juice also dripping from his chrome shaft, it becomes more difficult for me to explain.


There is a mystifying mural in the D Concourse of my airport that always fills me with unease.  It concerns some vaguely arcane theme, at least, I think it does, but one gets the impression that there are meanings and layers of meaning which lurk at the periphery of awareness.  


Beginning at one end of the walkway, a strange narrative surges with aggressive determination, hurtling toward a twist ending that will leave you breathless.  A parlor magician and his credulous hobgoblin assistant direct our eyes toward their magical equipment, which looks like a an abandoned miniature espresso stand.  Their faces have a pallid, greasy cast and their bone structure is blatant to the point of being ghoulish.  The implications are obvious.  They are magical ghouls, and you will watch their magic show or be destroyed.


They close the hatch on their espresso stand, which initially makes it look like a spectacular, polychromatic Ho ho.  Soon, it resembled a burrito made from the guts of broken kaleidoscopes rolling around on an audio/visual cart.  One can only imagine how difficult it was to move their surreal food before.  For the next two hundred feet of wallspace, they spin the cart around and around with singleminded purpose, occasionally glancing at the viewer in a threatening way. I've never had the courage to break eye contact with these fiends, as the latent violence of their expression has always produced the necessary stamina.   


When the suspense can no longer be borne, the burrito is breached to reveal a hermaphrodite.  I don't know if burritos are their larval stage, or what.  I have no idea what the fuck it is doing in there.  Honestly, the magicians seemed a little surprised too, but they can't make it look like the contents of their own Goddamn burrito were somehow unknown to them.  It begs the question - was he always in there?  Can hermaphrodites turn invisible?  Have we thus far underestimated the hermaphrodite threat?

There are other things to do at this convention, like finding out what the next Star Wars movie is called or seeing a preview of the Firefly movie, but we wouldn't know - we're in the dealer room pretty much the whole time.  Con attendees know perfectly well what dangers exist in there, such as the dangers of buying expensive bullshit with your food money, and that's why they leave it from time to time.  Imagine some depraved Vegas invention which could, in a single iteration of its evil purpose, obliterate your savings and replace the real artifacts of your life with convincing replicas of the sword from Lord of the Rings.  This is not some dark fantasy.  This is something that can actually happen, if you lack the cunning to contend with the treacherous dealer room and its huckster denizens.  


Eventually, ""Having To Go To The Bathroom"" was the useful lie, the gaudy pavilion beneath which all manner of commercial acts were committed.  Right about the time I had assembled a search party and sent them into the stalls, that fuckface would emerge from a crowd dressed entirely as a Tusken Raider or some other occupant of the Star Wars bestiary, shrugging his hairy Wampa shoulders in a science fiction approximation of our human gesture.  I won't lie to you, I'm not entirely without fault - I snuck out to the Alien Hominid and WizKids booths and, heaped high with goods like the tines of a forklift, navigated the convention over a dense knot of merchandise.


In years past, the girls that came by the booth to talk to us were largely here on some kind of surgical, get in, get out type mission - they had typically been sent by their boyfriends to obtain a sketch of the ""fruit robot.""  That was absolutely not the case this year.  In fact, girls would approach the booth with boyfriends who were not readers, and they could be heard defining the odd cosmology of Penny Arcade in a hushed voice.  I found this phenomenon mystifying.

I wanted to apologize to everyone who attended the Syndication panel on Sunday, at least, apologize to those who survived that guy from The Norm's fucking interminable sermons.  He was so boring that I literally thought I would die if he didn't shut up.  Maybe his strip is the bee's knees, I honestly don't care, but I have serious doubts regarding that man's ability to evoke joy.  


Like all old people, he is convinced that his suffering is somehow more genuine, his wisdom more relevant, or his victories more enduring than those of younger people.  Things got underway with Gabe saying that syndication was ""worthless,"" and things degenerated from there.  The Social Entropy forum tried to interject some lighthearted amusement into those dire proceedings, but the deck was stacked against them.  The man absorbs and annihilates humor.

I had a really great time in San Diego this year. I'd like to thank everyone who came out to our booth. We really appreciate it. 


I'm just going to list off some of the highlights of the trip for me. 


-I got to meet Kazu and the rest of the unbelievably talented artists from ""flight"". I heard that they had the second best selling book of the show and I believe it. It's a stunning collection of work and I highly recommend that you go out and pick up a copy if you haven't already. 


-I got a sketch of the Cardboard Tube Samurai from one of my favorite artists, Stephen Silver. You might not know the name but chances are you're familiar with his work. He's responsible for the look at feel of shows like the Clerks Animated series and Kim Possible. He is probably my biggest influence as an artist and having him do a sketch of one of my characters was a real treat.


-I was invited out to a sketchbook party in the lobby of a nearby hotel. It ended up being forty or fifty artists all passing their sketchbooks around and chatting. It took an incredible act of will power for me to overcome my debilitating anxiety and actually attend such an event. Now looking back on it, I'd say is was the high point of my trip. I met some incredible artists and learned a lot. 


-I had the opportunity to speak with Stan Sakai for a little bit. As it turns out he is actually aware of the CTS and not only that, he told me he likes my work. Hearing Stan Sakai tell me that my Samurai character was unique and well drawn was almost enough to stop my heart. He even drew a picture of Usagi slicing off Gabe's head with a Tube. I drew a picture of Usagi for him in exchange. I'm still having a hard time believing that the entire thing actually happened. 


Adam Warren came by the booth. It turns out he likes to read Penny Arcade. I was actually too nervous to speak to him while I was autographing his Penny Arcade sticker, and then later when I went looking for him he was gone. I’m not sure what I would have said to him had I actually found him. I probably would have just groaned and spit up a little.


-Tycho and I were invited to talk in a panel about syndication vs. web comics. I'm not sure why we were even there. We never think about Syndication and don't really have any desire to discuss it. At one point during the panel Tycho said that discussing syndication was like ""discussing the circulatory system of an extinct animal"".  Maybe in twenty years I'll be on a panel called web comics vs. hyper comics. Then some kid can tell me that creating comics for the web is out dated and that everyone should be making comics that are injected right into your brain.

One of the lessons I learned this year at San Diego was that I need to start carrying a sketchbook. I always knew that it was something I should do but I just never did it. I’ve decided to fix that and I’ve begun working really hard to keep a sketchbook and I love it. I figured I could solve another problem with the sketchbook as well, mainly my lack of updates to the gabeart section of the site. So I went ahead and redesigned gabeart to be a sketch dump site. I’ll still post finished illustrations in there when I do them, but I’m going to try and post a new sketch dump each week. I put the first batch up today if your interested in checking them out. A lot of it is just junk that most of you probably won’t care about. But I know as an artist I love looking at other artist’s sketchbooks and seeing how they work. I figure there might be a few of you out there who will find this stuff interesting. Doing the weekly sketch dumps should also keep me motivated to work in my sketchbook.

I went to Taco Bell last night and I was shocked at what I discovered. I understand that it is their policy to mess up my order. I expect now that what I ask for is never what will actually end up in my bag. It turns out that simply forgetting your burrito or shorting you a taco is no longer good enough for these sons of bitches though. Now they have decided that they needed to replace their awesome mexi-fries with new shitty fiesta fries. No more delicious and authentic seasoned tater treats. No sir, now you get disgusting little potato wedges fried in salt and sweat. I noticed something was wrong a few months ago when their combo meals no longer included mexi-fries. They tried to pawn off some shitty taco in their place but I would have none of that. “Fuck your taco bitch, I want my fries!” is what I was often heard to say. Now it’s obvious that their removal from the combo meals was simply a precursor to a much larger mexi-fri conspiracy. They are now missing entirely from the menu and every bit of evidence that proved they ever existed has been meticulously removed and probably destroyed. Did those filthy Taco Bell bastards really think I would simply forget how much I liked mexi-fries? Its bullshit like this that makes me worry about bringing a child into the world. These are dark times indeed.


Oh, they also got some new exclusive drink called Mountain Dew Baja Blast. If you are curious what this stuff tastes like, simply drink a bottle of Scope.

We could not have made up the special Bald Eagle Family T-Shirts, we simply don't have the ability to conjure an image of that power.  Everything in this strip is quite true, Doom is coming out, country bait stores rarely carry software, and I desperately hope that Gabriel dies in water.  Please say a silent prayer for Gabriel as he endures this week.  Special Alternate Task For Atheists:  Deny your maker.   


A large part of why my marriage functions is that I rarely see the person I'm married to, and if we do see each other we're too exhausted to fight about anything.  You might think this has nothing to do with gaming or geekery, when it is in actuality the core of what makes my life possible.  I'm often asked how I find the time to play the games I talk about, and it's really very simple.  I'm emotionally inaccessible to my life partner.    


In the Monster Manual, she and I have different Activity Cycles that overlap slightly in the evening, during which time we consume a DVD in strained silence.  This scenario is maintained by two cardinal rules which must be upheld at all costs, lest genuine dialogue occur.  


1.  She must never be exposed to any household tasks involving Cat Shit.


2.  All gaming must be accomplished with the use of headphones.


The first one is easy enough.  The second one had a single exception, the Xbox in the living room, until Crimson Skies was released.  You and I are quite used to repetitive cues being broadcast to us constantly, we can derive the information - which side has the flag, let's say - without consciously processing each statement.  Not so for her, and the fortieth time she heard that the ""Blue Team"" had ""Dropped The Booty,"" it created a conflict that I was sure would result in the dissolution of our union.  I was able to resolve this particular issue via the X2VGA converter, and we were able to resume our prior arrangement, but for a time we were dangerously proximate to true self-analysis.    


Since I am free to play games so long as they do not project in the the audible realm, I had always assumed that this precluded any access to more advanced Sound Configurations, such as the elusive 5.1 that has become more and more prevalent.  I can recall the day in 2000 when I discovered that a common pair of headphones could be made to emulate positional audio, quite the revelation at the time, like discovering that your penis is also a magic wand.  Hearing word that there were actually wearable 5.1 audio setups was just as startling.  There are a few options in this space, but Zalman - makers of those odd ""flower"" cooling mechanisms and that silent, fan-free case - have a solution of this sort that should arrive today.  I'll let you know how it goes.      


We just finished a new long-form project, think the PA Presents stuff, for Gearbox Software's Brothers In Arms.  We had an unprecedented level of access to the developer of this game, and by unprecedented access I mean that there is a far greater degree of integration between our work and the game itself.  Not only did we have access to hundreds of megabytes of what your teacher would have called ""Primary Sources,"" the guys over there have been doing research of various kinds for as many as three years and were happy to talk to us whenever we had a question.  The execution of this one has absolutely nothing in common with our prior work of this type - it's far more intimate.  If we have done our jobs correctly - and I believe that we have - there will be nothing, visually or stylistically, to reveal it as our work.

Before Gabe hit the road, he asked me very politely to mention his new sketch dump over at GabeArt, and I didn't do it.  He doesn't say what they are, but the cowboys he drew are an updated form of a comic we've always planned to do called Sand.  It has a ridiculously elaborate backstory, as all post-apocalyptic westerns should.


That's one of the things we were working on in High School, actually - we even started doing it.  We had this little eight page ""first issue"" you could buy for a quarter.  The guy at the comic shop let us put them right by the register, which seemed like a good location.

He has returned, but don't get too excited.  It's just for this one comic, and then he's going back.   


I can say without satisfaction that we've been less than kind to Doom 3 over the course of its development.  We make the calls that seem appropriate based on the information that exists, and by and large I think we do alright.  Precisely because of the technology that runs it, the screenshots it produces are incapable of communicating what it can do in fullness.  Simply put, you have never seen the things you will see playing this game.  I'll give you an example.    


They have a monster who is an upside-down head with legs, a la The Thing.  If you look at it in a screenshot, it looks pretty stupid.  When you see that the thing is actually draped with wet skin, skin that looks absolutely real in the simulated light, you might pull your feet back from under your computer desk.  Even their rocket heads were not as hilarious as still screens make them out to be.  Certainly, your introduction to them is highly unpleasant - but you probably know that already.  


My machine is not new in any interpretation of that word.  The only real claim to fame I have on here is the SATA RAID I sometimes refer to with affection - outside of that, we're talking about an AMD 2400, a gig of RAM, and a 9700 Pro.  A couple summers ago, you might have coveted this beast at a LAN Party.  These days, Farcry takes this machine out behind the woodshed.  


I am startled at how well this game performs.


I'm running ATI's 4.9 Beta drivers, designed with this game in mind, and I'm able to play the game at 1024 by 768, high quality, with enough performance to feel like I'm getting the real deal.  The game itself chose 800 by 600, but I have a reputation to maintain.  If it chose the same thing for you, make the jump to 1024 manually and see if you can tolerate it.  I think you'll agree, that simple leap is the difference between ""marginal improvement over other genre entries"" and ""I am looking through my monitor at events which are occurring on another world.""     


id's storytelling, too, has come a long way.  Someone over there played and loved Irrational's System Shock 2, working the notion of e-mails and audio diaries into the experience.  Let me say something about the interfaces in game for a moment - the computers one interacts with are essentially perfect.  Crisp, clean, genuine interfaces you manually interact with.  As a developer, you're going to have a hard time getting away with some muddy, two-state texture after this.  


I think that what I had expected was another piece of powerful technology gummed to a bare-bones proof of concept.  That was cynical of me, but id virtually invented the ""free standing tech demo as game"" format.  I'm happy to be wrong - this is a rich experience in its own right, cunning use of custom technology married to narrative enough to provide momentum.  When one of these mod teams finalizes a co-op experience for this game, you may not hear from me for a while.    


The Zalman Theatre 6 I can't recommend so easily.  It's not the price that I find worrisome, I don't have any problem paying sixty dollars for something I'm going to use every day for hours on end.  It's just that before I had them, I wasn't aware just how effective simulated surround sound was.  If you don't have a point of reference, something to compare it to, there is this auditory wonderland that is just beyond your reach, and no technology enthusiast likes that sensation.  Don't get me wrong - these headphones are an improvement over stereo headphones, which are themselves an improvement over two channel stereo speakers.  In my case, this is the only Surround Sound I'm likely to own.  The thing that is really potent about an actual surround sound setup that isn't communicated by this device is that, in a room set up for this kind of equipment, not only do sounds fire from a specific position, they fire from another location in space.  The position is captured well enough, but you won't be looking around the room for imps - the sense of a larger audio environment, as opposed to one that is simply more precise, was always (for me) the ""point.""


At any rate, when I was setting everything up I found a surround sound audio file that helped me test things out.  If you decide to take some kind of audio plunge, it might come in handy.

While you are digesting today's comic, I have something that might give you a bit of context.


In addition to the other things I have mentioned - and the things I will mention - PAX will also have large banners emblazoned with characters from the comic.  Of course, there are versions which are particular to each room, as well - but there are also ones with Twisp and Catsby, Div and the Fruit Fucker, etc.  There's one of the Cardboard Tube Samurai.  And there's one of Gabe, tugging earnestly on Tycho's penis, as a robin would an earthworm.  Observe:  




I mean, seriously.  Look at him go.  You'd think that Tycho would appreciate that sort of dedication.


I told Gabe as much, which lead to the conversation in the comic strip, during and after which he was as angry as I've ever seen him.  Why he would be angry at me is an absolute mystery - I didn't take some drawing of his and use the ""move"" tool to nudge Gabe's grasping paw hand over my character's genitals.  With purpose and conviction, he drew a sexually charged encounter that was designed to be printed six feet tall.  So now, not only is there a scene of basest fornication being played out, it's being performed by a race of carnal, homosexual giants.         


Every guerilla cartoonist online deploys this same format, our characters (and by association, ourselves) are driven by gay lust, and they revel in their creation as though they have invented some new pejorative technology.  You'd imagine Gabe would be going out of his way to avoid this sort of imagery, putting the characters in different Zip Codes, or using science fiction to create a plausible ""Galactic Diaspora"" scenario by which Gabe and Tycho, on remote artificial worlds, are able to meet but not physically touch via faster-than-light holographic transmissions.        


He's not changing it, just to spite me you understand, so if you want to see some amateur action just come look at the banners at PAX.  They're pretty hot.

377,2004-08-09,Those Kinds of Conversations,"
Gabriel has returned - haunted and harrowed by woodland beasts to be sure, but otherwise ready to accomplish our noble endeavor.  There's also an odd, stunted conversation between myself and Kara, so there really is something for everyone.  


I never went into Scott's syndication panel very deeply here on the site, though Gabe touched on it a bit, but something kind of interesting happened there not related to our poor behavior that should probably see the light of day: Scott plans to offer PvP to newspapers directly, free of charge.  Personally, I think that is pretty crafty - but that's not to say it's like twisting off the cap and getting an Instant Win.  Now he has to work and work and work, something we here at Penny Arcade deplore.  I mean, shit, papers are welcome to Penny Arcade too, if they want it.  I think the one where the obsolete home appliance calls his roommates fairies really has a universal resonance.  The reason I'm bringing all this up though is that the response to Scott's caper by some syndicated cartoonists is hyper-revealing.


You really do have to go check this thread about it - with the understanding that you are entering a beautiful, untouched, federally protected Ignorance Reserve and should tread lightly.  It is for exactly this reason that I detest forums of all kinds.  They bring human nature into such stark relief that it can be difficult to bear.  


Usually I have to say something ridiculous and then attribute it to another person, but in this case no such prestidigitation is required.  You're here, this morning, with me - you know that not only are there many, many webcomics, between one and ten for every discrete human endeavor, there are also as many as twenty cartoonists making a living from their wholly owned creative output on the web.  The clear inference one can make is that there are now multiple routes to cartooning ""success"" - books and long-form stories, syndication in alternative weeklies and newspapers, or a new category - webcomics.  Freely distributed or as part of a premium bundling system like PVComics, it has advantages and disadvantages just like the other mediums.  Currently, one of things that can be tough about it is that you need to invent your own system to support yourself if you want to make it a full time thing.  It's tough, but it isn't insurmountable - I see webcomics that haven't been online for a week with a full range of Cafe Press merchandise and a Paypal donation button.  Four years ago, those things would have been anathema to our medium.  We grew up fast.         


It seems odd to think that a person who is interested in comics as a medium wouldn't be aware of this surging force, hadn't heeded the words of the Prophet McCloud (pbuh).  You can see those people in that thread if you like, really take it in.  Now, as in any human population, intellect rides a gradient and there's certainly a distribution on display.  Some of those people I would be proud to call mentors.  Some claim not to be threatened by Scott's plan when they plainly are, some claim to be aware of the development of webcomics as a medium when they plainly aren't.  If you claim, for example, that the best strips in the US are all syndicated, you lose - and if I see you, I will kick your walker and you will fall down the stairs.  


Some people just say the same thing over and over again - how will Scott make money giving away his strip for free?  How will he do it?  They await his failure with delectation.  I have news for those people, these lampreys fucking latched on to the ground down bones of an old order:  Scott Kurtz is already a success.  Idiots.  He has a monthly book through Image, and characters millions of people love.  He can't fail.  All he can do is remain Awesome.  I know you're looking forward to seeing another young buck go down.  You go ahead, you ride your fucking corpse to the bottom of the sea.  You can say hi to all the other outmoded exiles from modern life.

I survived my week in the woods and I feel pretty good. It ended up raining almost the entire time we were there which meant that everyone was stuck indoors. Thankfully I had the wisdom to bring a Gamecube and a PS2. Much of my time at the lake was actually spent inside playing Warioware, Karaoke Revolution and Tales of Symphonia. Pretty much everyone in Kara’s family is an incredibly talented singer. Each and every one of them was born with the ability to hear a song once and then reproduce it almost perfectly. This is not something I can do. It’s not even something I can comprehend. They all got hooked on Karaoke Revolution and battled it out tournament style each night. Kara ended up winning the whole thing by nailing a 100% perfect score on a Nora Jones song. I did a rendition of “I hate everything about you” that I would describe as emotionally charged. It certainly got a laugh out of everyone present and I was asked to repeat it at various points during the week for the benefit of family members who had not heard it yet. This became my signature song and out of respect it was never performed by anyone else again. 


Plenty of funny things happened during the week but out of respect for Kara and her very nice family I won’t go into any details here. I will say that I have a brother in law from Chile who speaks very little English and whose favorite movie is Little Orphan Annie. Watching him dance in front of the television, while belting out “Hard Knock Life” in his heavy Chilean accent was a real treat. At one point he lost the tape and spent a few hours franticly searching for it since he had rented it from the library. Someone asked him when it was due back and I suggested that perhaps it was due TOMORROW, TOMORROW! They just love me.

Doom 3 is dark, etc.  Also, an imp develops a unique method for dominating humanity and two zombies have a dialogue about respect. 


Catching up with MacHall, I saw Ian's recent post regarding Doom 3 that should provide a counterpoint to the largely positive reviews now available - you won't need to look hard to find them, indeed, you can simply look at the content from this site a couple days ago.  For my part, Doom 3 calls to mind Resident Evil: Director's Cut for the Cube, which managed to create a new experience that invested my (by now) amplified memories of the original with something genuine.  


There's really no argument to be made regarding how dark the game is - this is a factual statement.  And, just as in Doom, the game will often punish you for grabbing health or armor by spawning enemies.  Those are both real things, but the value you can associate with each of them varies - for whatever reason, they didn't manage to wreck it for me.  I cried out on more than one occasion, and eventually came to appreciate those surround sound headphones.  I actually enjoyed checking the corners with the flashlight.  I enjoyed activating a person's audio log in my PDA, and then letting its cautionary tale run while I explored the facility.  Everybody who was going to buy it probably owns it now, so the phase where I try to convince you is over.  You know for yourself whether or not using a flashlight constitutes an onerous burden.                   


The thing that doesn't quite rise to the level is the multiplayer, which just isn't very ambitious.  They've been preparing us for that though, going on multiple years, so while we can be disappointed by the situation we can't really claim any surprise.  The UI is rife with odd inconsistencies, for example it seems to think we have thirty LAN games currently running on our three computer network.  It hasn't been very stable for whatever reason on Gabe's machine, but in the moments before the full system lock we typically enjoy ourselves a good deal - it's the sort of thing we might have experienced during the Quake 2 LAN games we used to initiate with great regularity.  Honestly, the multiplayer portion of this game is only the dias upon which genuine multiplayer experiences will be created by mod authors, and I never really thought otherwise.  Having already completed and enjoyed the single player portion, any enjoyment I'm able to squeeze out of the game in multi fits squarely into the Icing category.         


Something else to note - if Doom didn't turn your crank, or perhaps did not turn it one complete rotation, it's starting to sound like you won't have long to wait for Half-Life 2.  Valve just announced that on the 17th of this month, the Half-Life 2 ""Pre-load"" will begin, consisting of art and audio assets that won't change before release.  I wish that I'd just said it a day earlier, because then I would have the universal affection of my peers - but I'd heard that review sites are already being contacted by PR about getting a copy over Steam for their articles soon.

I've written at length concerning the multiplayer in Pandora Tomorrow, and outside of some strange exploits - things I'd rather not discuss, lest they enter greater circulation - it's a very exciting game to watch or play.  The people that are still playing that game on Live (or the PC version, I'd imagine) are so much better than I am that going online hasn't been a source of enjoyment for me in months.  Gabe still plays (and succeeds) quite regularly, which should tell you something about his skill level.  He and Doctor K can be seen most nights in there, choking or shooting men, depending.  They would, anyway, provided they could find other players that actually wanted to play the game they bought and not some game they made up for the fuck of it right then and there. 


Most games you join, and I'm here when they jump in so I can see it, are either Deathmatch or Tag - not any of the games you might associate with ""stealth.""  Deathmatch, I hope that's something you can figure out on your own.  Tag is somewhat more elaborate.  The rules, if I understand it correctly, are as follows:  



3 spies versus 1 mercenary, each spy gets one respawn, and the mercenary gets three.  If there are only two spies, the merc gets two lives.



Time is unlimited.  Warehouse is sometimes used for this gametype, but when playing on Deftech no-one is allowed to enter buildings.



Whoever the mercenary kills first is ""it"" next game.


I've heard of Predator as well, a three merc/one spy situation if memory serves.  


As a person who doesn't actively play it anymore, the prevalence and indeed succession of Tag or Deathmatch as gametypes doesn't really affect me that much.  It wouldn't affect them either, if these were sanctioned ways to play the game that were recognized in the interface and could be culled from the list.  What happens more often than not is that these games are so widespread that people presume you are playing with the imaginary rules only to become enraged when told otherwise, or they enter the game without any discussion and begin playing the game they think everyone else is playing and lose.


I wonder how something like Halo 2, with its menu driven creation of custom games, will handle this.  I absolutely endorse the notion of ginning up your own games in the Splinter Cell context, don't get me wrong about that.  I just wish there was some way to identify, or at the very least define mechanically these creative scenarios as being independent from the official ones.  As it stands, they've kind of taken over.

People who think that we go ""too far"" would fall over dead if they heard the discussions that actually produce these comics.  The one catalogued in the strip is (to my mind) fairly minor.  I'd rather not go into any more detail than that, and besides - you've probably just eaten breakfast.  


I can't recall the last time I was as obsessed with something to the extent that I am obsessed with I Love Bees.  If Brenna asks what I am doing and I tell her that I am ""Tending My Bees,"" she knows that I am not capable of a productive conversation.  


ILB hit big on the Game News radar when the first revelations were made, and I haven't seen much on it since - but revelations like those and the subsequent processing of the missives happens virtually every day at the NetNinja Wiki.  They seize on each snip of dialogue, gumming the out of context fragments together into monologues of startling clarity - then, going to a greater level of magnification, they add context and speculation to their reconstituted script.

This thing is so tuned to my predilections that I'm without power to resist it.  It includes translation, where data changes form but retains meaning, I could literally go on about that all day.  But it also includes my weakness, my undoing, which is Artificial Intelligence.  I guess it's not a surprise that a dork would be endlessly drawn to the notion of disembodied intellects - but Bungie in particular had always dealt with the issue via the Marathon games that I found particularly resonant.  The language in the ILB itself is studded with jargon unique to the physical sensation of electronic awareness.  It sets my heart to beating, but you can see why - it's the notion that intellect is inviolate and can survive transition to another medium.  It's just translation all over again.      


There is a lot we don't know yet about the ILB mysteries, but there are basic things that we do - the site relates a kind of story that takes place in something near real time.  It's a story about a military artificial intelligence from the Halo/Marathon universe that resides on the I Love Bees server, infected by rogue and more than possibly Covenant software.  My guess is that we are seeing the story of how the Covenant discovers the location of Earth.  If you're fascinated you can find out the rest for yourself.  The I Love Bees phenomenon is promotional in nature, at least at the most basic level - but it could still deliver its promotional payload without delivering an excellent, unconventional story.

I picked up the most recent issue of Official Playstation Magazine yesterday. I grabbed it because I saw it had a demo of Burnout 3 on the disk. I’ll just say I was not disappointed. That game is shit hot and I highly recommend you go get a copy of it for yourself. My only complaint is that after the one race they allow you in the demo you are kicked all the way back out to the main menu of the disk. I guess this is because they want to remind you that there are other games and movies available there but the only thing you’re going to want to play is Burnout. I almost feel bad for the other racing game demos on the disk. Maybe they didn’t know their game would be featured alongside Burnout 3. As I drove one of their destruction derby cars around a crappy looking track at approximately five miles per hour I actually felt embarrassed for them. 


The other interesting thing I saw mentioned in OPM this month was in their rumor section. They suggest that Sega has finally realized what an incredible game REZ was and they have decided to re-release it and possibly even produce a sequel. Now this is a rumor that I’ve heard a few times before but I still get excited each time it pops up. If you ever attend one of our question and answer panels you will hear someone ask us what our favorite game is. You will then hear Tycho say Dynamite Cop for the Dreamcast and you will hear me say REZ. To this day, I still play REZ every couple of weeks. As much as I’d love to see a new REZ game I’m not entirely sure I want Sega to make it. I just don’t know that I can trust them anymore to make a quality game. If I had it my way Harmonix would make the next REZ game.

One day we will learn the trick of making our bullets intersect with enemy models - at least, that's the hope - as apparently emptying a submchinegun at point-blank range is not up to the task.  In the meantime, we can ponder Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow's deep mysteries.


For example, why does it look so mediocre?  This is the most powerful hardware on the market, and it feels like the system is actually choking on the game.  I'm not expecting it to look like the PC version, which is my primary experience with the series - I'm expecting it to conform a bit more to the visual pedigree Xbox gamers have come to know, and the prowess its contemporaries have shown.  Since it is essentially a full-priced mission pack, it had been my hope that they had (perhaps via a mysterious ritual!) discerned some new technique for getting the most out of the technology.  I don't really see any evidence of that.  Every now and then they tease you with Splinter Cell-esque fidelity, and they flip right back to their usual pragmatism.  In anything but broad daylight, the muddy green texture and the muddy tan texture used to distinguish the teams don't have a lot of utility.  When your tough military guy texture looks exactly like a naked man smeared with guacamole, it's time to think hard about where you might have gone wrong.   


Of course, at least part of the blame for any lag must go to Live, for making players host listen servers on their vile consumer level connections.  Beyond that, the game can still run a bit rough, even when you take this into account and keep the games down to an eight player maximum.  Eight players is about where I like it, actually - that's not even the issue.  They know what they're getting into, putting a game in the Live environment - if they've made any special effort to accommodate it, then you fooled me.      


They introduce a great new gametype in Black Arrow, a couple actually, but our current favorite is Retrieval - it's similar to One Flag CTF, each team must grab a cannister that spawns and then drop it in their own bin.  The only trouble is that the Goddamn cannister spawns underground once every few games, below the earth, turning the cool goal-oriented game mode they just made up into instant Deathmatch.  This happens whenever you play Retrieval for any length of time.  I think it's fair to ask why.      


That it manages to be fun despite these things is beyond me.  These issues, arrayed like an obstacle course, obscuring amusement, have the effect of amplifying each personal success.  When you do hit somebody, perhaps because it doesn't happen a lot, you start to believe unrealistic things about yourself - you might imagine, for example, that you could fuck a hole in a tank.  And it's nice to see the Live 3.0 stuff in there, creating Clans (they call them ""Squads"") that persist on the service.  What I don't understand is having a sure thing, and then not executing it.

Surely this installment of Penny Arcade is a falsification of the worst sort!  Friends, if only that were true.  When he started telling me about Dust, as though it were a topic that was somehow alien to me, alien to the tens of thousands of people that play every day on ""Dust Only"" servers, I felt something pop inside my mind.    


I showed him the Goddamn thing years ago, starting with Beta 3 - as soon as he saw that text based buy menu, he was done looking at it and nothing could redirect his attention.  The next time he paid even a moment's notice to Counter-Strike was Sunday at Lanwerx, where they're currently running the new version mounted on Half-Life 2's Source engine.        


Nowadays, you can detest Counter-Strike and come by it honestly.  Somewhere near your thousandth round of Aztec, it might occur to you that other games have been released in the intervening period.  Or you think 1.6 is bullshit, for example - you don't like the Riot Shield or something.  Some people left when they introduced dual pistols, every patch had something abhorrent to this or that demographic.  Whatever.  That's cool.  But you had the phase, you played the most popular online shooter with your friends and then got out.  That's a matter quite apart from looking up briefly from a Star Wars novel and then shrugging your shoulders.   


The new version of CS is open now to anyone who owns Condition Zero, so I've had a chance to check it out from home now as well - and I'm glad I did, because it was a different experience.  The machines I was on at the cafe weren't rendering the game in DirectX 9, which gives a somewhat faulty impression of the visual improvements.  We only have one map to judge it on, and de_dust as you might imagine has no water, so there isn't much to be blown away by in terms of effects just jumpin' out at you.  The room in the middle where everything happens, I'm sure there's a colloquial term for it, is now in the base of a dome filled with glowing sunlight and lazily drifting dust.  That was nice.  But there's not a river or something running through the middle of the map, deforming the crystals stuck in the silt beneath, accurately reflecting you as you look them.  I'm not saying it should have that.  I'm just saying that every inch of Dust is yellow rock, so it really isn't a platform for bold technology.  There's an interesting thread on the Steam forums regarding the points where CS: Source diverges from canon, and is required reading for mortals fascinated by the topic.     


Being able to see CS:Source running on two wildly divergent classes of machine makes me think you could get it going acceptably just about anywhere, which I think is probably Job One as far as Valve is concerned.  The graphical improvements are not of the Doom 3 ""look at this shadow"" variety - they tend to be fairly subtle touches even under the best circumstances, adding drama and fidelity when available and simply improving on the original in other circumstances.  I find the new flashbang highly disorienting, its overwhelming light a precursor to my own Damascus conversion.  We expect physics now, flying bodies and whatnot, but I have yet to see this game render them in the ridiculous poses we've been treated to thus far - no terrorist marionettes doing calisthenics in the desert.        


It still feels exactly like Counter-Strike to me.  Maybe you'll like that and maybe you won't.  I'm sure someone will start talking about Innovation soon and how there Isn't Much Of It, and how mankind used to Innovate in the perfect world before history.  But even for a person who has made a point of escaping the game altogether, I'm in desperate danger of a relapse.  When you've played that map as many times as I have, as you have I'm sure, it ceases to be a game exercise and approaches some kind of meditation.  The base and rodentine portion of my brain threads that yellow maze and my pure being is ready for utter contemplation.       


He and Kara play the new CS nightly now, I believe.  His wife, who currently contains a viable human being, is an absolutely lethal sniper.  Reconciling those two things is always a bit odd.

The conversation is real, but he didn't have it with Kara - I'm given to understand that she has the equivalent of super strength in this ""trimester"" or whatever it is called, and has the capacity to deal aggravated damage.  Gabriel informed me yesterday that she lifted a car over her head, and threw that car at another car and then climbed up an office building.  After a spectacle like that, your discourse tends to bear the proper reverence.

 
When I was telling Pork about
the new Myst game, he was somewhat incredulous.  Not about whether or
not there was one, now - that's easy to verify.
He was just shocked that they were still making them.  Also, shocked
that I was still playing them, as though it were an odd thing to
be doing in the modern age, like churning my own butter. Anachronistic.

 
They really do keep making them, though, and not just atmospheric
puzzle games like Myst - there's even been a few entries in its sister genre,  graphic adventure, which I felt sure had passed into that long night.  So, if they continue to produce them, it stands to reason that someone continues to buy them.  It seems to me that this group of people is probably very small, but perhaps so staunchly dedicated to the twisting of ancient knobs that they will buy anything emblazoned with a surreal edifice.


I might not be writing about Myst IV at all if, after completing the demo, something hadn't caught my eye.  You know as well as I do that after one finishes the demo for a retail product, they are invariably buffeted by a series of advertisements that must be got through if one is to regain control of their machine.  I am so used to disregarding information of this sort that each page of these presentations registers to my conscious mind as white light.  Some piece of relevant data had apparently crept into that region, though - so I reloaded the game and quit it again just to see.  True enough, Myst IV is being released only on DVD.  To which I say, thank God.


Apparently they're also releasing the first three games on DVD as well, but that's neither here nor there at the moment.  I'd heard rumors that Farcry was being released on DVD only, which drowned my heart in secret delight, because something would finally force my hand on the issue.  It's not like I needed much cajoling to purchase a piece of hardware - indeed, I think of any computer purchase below 200 dollars as virtually nonexistent, and feel comfortable making a virtually unlimited number of these transactions.  I have emerged from Fry's heaped high with silicon, as our primitive forebears once lumbered from caves weighed down by exotic furs.   


At the same time, I do need a reason to buy something, even if it is a flimsy, almost insubstantial reason.  It seems almost silly to me that it's a puzzle game that eventually did it, jostled me into modernity.  No doubt this fact injures my credentials irreparably.

In what observers called a ""shocking reversal,"" I deferred to our defeated foe TribalWar regarding the showing Tribes: Vengeance had at E3.  I did so because what I saw there should not have been shown to anybody, anywhere, let alone people whose job it is to trasmit information about the videogame industry.  I checked out the new equipment, loadout interfaces, no real issues with it on that score, but the network performance was so poor that I really had no idea what they were thinking.  And, since I never saw this plain, direct observation appear anywhere else, I wasn't sure exactly what was going on.  Here is the mind-bending theory I generated:  The game wasn't finished yet.  Presumably, we're supposed to go to an event like E3 and come to genuine conclusions about things.  The trouble is that sometimes we're only given a few handfulls of chicken guts, and we're supposed to somehow derive the value of x.  More than any other expo, this year's event was thick with proto-games - green around the edge and nowhere near ready for consumption.
Well, we'll soon have a good deal more than fresh organs and dark magic with which to divine the quality of this particular title - it's apparently very near complete.  Previews can be usually be counted on to laud the ""return"" to Tribes One era game speeds, which is at best simply good copy.  Everything I have played and read leads me to believe the game as we receive it will be faster still than Tribes.  Air control has been elaborated on.  Skiing, intially an exploit, now has royal imprimatur as opposed to the wink and nod of Tribes 2.  Beyond player control, the maps are wide open and the flag sits on an open pedestal like an hors d'oeuvre, vulnerable and toothsome.  That all says speed to me.  Speed, and lots of it.

392,2004-08-26,Warlocks!,"
I like to play World of Warcraft. When I play this sort of game I tend to get attached to my character and I don’t really feel comfortable making new ones. I’m not sure exactly what it is, but once I’ve got my guy I stick with him no matter what. As each new patch comes out Blizzard opens up new classes for play. Once I started my Warlock though I never really saw any reason to switch. I guess that makes me a shitty beta tester, but I don’t really care. Besides, there are so many fucking hunters in the game right now it’s ridiculous. I was in Westfall yesterday and it was like Noah’s fucking ark. 






Since I’ve really only ever played a Warlock I tend to think about them a lot. As of right now Blizzard does not seem to have a real clear idea of what the Warlock should be. They’re really just shitty mages with pets. There is really no reason to invite a Warlock into your party and so I tend to have a hard time finding groups. People are always asking for a healer or a tank or maybe a rogue. If someone is asking for a warock it’s usually just for health stones or a free teleport. I still love my Warlock though and I’ve spent a good deal of time imagining the sorts of things I’d like for him to be able to do. I figured it wouldn’t hurt anything if I just went ahead and posted my Warlock ideas here. Maybe Blizzard will read them, maybe they won’t. At least I’ll have shared them with someone other than Tycho who I don’t think really gives a shit, but is very polite when I start talking about soul shards.


Gabe’s Crazy Warlock Ideas!


I don’t know how to write this out in a way that makes sense, so I’m just going to spit out all my ideas in no particular order.


The way I see it, the entire warlock class should be based on the concept of trades. The idea here is that these are magic users who have decided to consort with demons in order to become more powerful. That’s awesome and all, but as of right now the demons aren’t getting anything out of this deal. Everything I know about beings from hell tells me they don’t give up anything unless they get something in return. Maybe it’s money, maybe it’s some other kind of sacrifice.  


I think the warlock should have a few incredibly powerful spells that have equally high risks involved. Maybe he could deal a ton of damage to a wide area but then he’d be useless for five or six seconds. In a party situation this might be cool. Once he’s done doing his thing the rest of the party could keep an eye on him until he’s conscious again. He might even become possessed for a short period of time. While possessed, his mana would be draining away but he might have access to a new set of attacks or spells. A warlock who is possessed might be capable of dealing insane amounts of melee damage but he might have a hard time staying on target. This goes back to the trade off concept. Maybe you have a warlock in your party beating the fuck out of some monster, then all of a sudden he comes at you. 


The talent system for warlocks has not been implemented yet. I’d like to see an ability tree for them that actually had multiple demons on it, and advancing through the tree equaled gaining more and more favor with these individual demons. Some kind of fire demon for instance might allow you immolation at the beginning but as you prove yourself through class specific quests he might open up new more powerful fire spells for you. Demons always want humans to go and do shit for them. I’d like to see more of this sort of thing for warlocks.


What if while in a group you could trade one of the players in your party for a demon? Say you were about to go into a crazy fight, maybe the warlock could make a deal and trade one of his companions for a powerful demon. The player getting traded might slip into the spirit world as long as the demon was there. That’s the kind of evil shit I want my warlock to do. They are essentially the middlemen between hell and earth. The sorts of deals they are able broker between those two parties seems really interesting to me.


Warlocks should be able to bring someone back from the dead, but it should work a bit differently. When dead, if a warlock is near and he offers to revive you a contract should appear on your screen. He might require money or a soul shard in exchange for bringing you back. If you click okay you essentially sign the contract and your back in business.


Soul shards are cool but I should be able to do more with them. It would be awesome if warlocks could use soul shards in their crafting of items and clothing. Armor made from soul shards for example might protect you against certain spells or even other warlocks. 


The role of the warlock in a party isn’t really clear yet. Like I said there is no reason as of right now to invite one to join you. He ends up just taking away XP and not offering anything back to the group. I’d like to see the concept of “trade offs” apply to a warlock’s role in a group as well. They should be able to do some wild shit for a party but you never know if something they try might backfire. It should be a sort of risk vs. reward type of deal. A warlock might be able to deal a thousand points of damage in one explosion of power but to gain that ability he might need an offering for his demon master from everyone in the party. Does he want health, mana, money, or maybe even someone’s life? 


I’d say that right now warlocks are the kings of soloing in the game. With my pets I can go out and fuck up just about anything I want without to much trouble. I really don’t need to group if I don’t want to. To me that fits with the class, they are loners. When playing a warlock you often find your trainers tucked away in dark basements. These are evil fucking people who hang out with demons all day. Taking one into your party should be a gamble. There needs to be a high enough possible payoff that people will want to do it, but they should never quite know what they are going to get.

sophistry in the service of their goals, truly epic feats like
sitting on the couch or watching television.  In these situations, I
can be counted on to act as his barely responsive interlocutor.


When we hatch these ridiculously elaborate plots, I'm thinking
specifically of PAX
now, I never imagine it all the way to the back-breaking physical
labor.  It is as though I secretly believe that they will never
happen.  It's similar to how one day we thought it would be nice to
have a toy drive, and then all of the sudden we were spending upwards
of ten hours a day opening presents.  I'll continue to plan capers of
this sort, with the expectation that I will be eternally surprised
when they emerge from their ethereal coccoons.  Something very large
is about to do exactly that, and I am having a hard time coming to
terms with it.


Pre-registraton ended with 1337 attendees in total, and though I
ordinarily shun leet-speak that number clearly implies the blessing of
gaming deities.  We were here until midnight stuffing two-thousand
bags full of convention goodies.  Could all of those really represent
people?  Also, have you ever seen the Meydenbauer Center?  It
is the sort
of place that legitimizes any event you hold at it.  You feel
important just being there.  It has a beautiful theater in it where
you can hold a perfectly legitimate Final
Fantasy themed piano recital.  It has escalators.  Yeah,
it's that kind of place.


Then, when I'm already freaking out, the Seattle Times does a work-up
on us for the business section.  You might find it interesting to see
a somewhat alien perspective on what we do here.  There's only one
portion of the article that I'd take issue with, and that is the part
about ""selling the company.""  Without any context, that makes it look
as though we're just here pruning this website so that it will
eventually be acceptable to some wealthy suitor.  The reality is that
we understand we can't do this forever.  At this future point, long
after you are concerned with its fate and we have been consigned to
history, maybe someone else will own the site.  That's basically that.


If you've seen us at cons or whatever, you've probably already met the
Robert mentioned in that piece - he's also been in the strip a couple
times.
He acts as a buffer between us and the ""business"" portion of making
comics.  He also makes sure we don't inadvertently sell Penny Arcade,
and before you laugh at that, please understand that this is something
we actually did at one point.  I don't really want to be good at
business, so we could either elect to be taken advantage of by people
who are or bind to us a monster of our own.  We chose the option
that sounded the most like necromancy.


In the meantime, we continue to make comics about genitals while our
hideous servants create empires around them.  I really wouldn't have
it any other way.  Although, I do wish that I could have five
consecutive minutes without the fear of every good thing in my life
evaporating.

It's not something I ever expect to happen, you understand - I don't think you're clamoring for the opportunity, it's just something I worry about.  Thus far, we've been to cons where there was a certain percentage of readers among the attendees and it hasn't happened yet.  In my apparently infinite wisdom, we chose to hold a convention populated almost exclusively by the readership.  So it's starting to look less like my greatest fear and more like my secret wish.


Here's the comic, which is about something unrelated to the rest of the post. 


I hardly know how to condense the last forty hours.  Before now I could not imagine what would occur after PAX, the future was a sort of featureless expanse.  Apparently, the future consists of me sitting here in the dark trying to make sense of my life while I choke down the worst pot of coffee I have ever made - acrid, and vaguely folgerian.


To say that the Penny Arcade Exposition is the best convention that has ever existed or will exist initially sounds like hyperbole.  More than twice as many people attended than pre-registered, and we simply had to do the best we could - our volunteers were uniformly excellent under some very strenuous conditions, and I thank them for it.  Certainly there were issues that had to do with scheduling tournaments and so forth that occur at everything like this.  There were scheduling conflicts that made it difficult to enjoy all of the convention, requiring you to be strategic about things in a way that might have minimized your enjoyment.  I wish that hadn't happened.


The musical event - with Connie's recital, Optimus Rhyme, Minibosses, and The Front - was the sort of thing that changes a person's life, provided you got in to see it.  At any other show, lighters might have emerged during the more tender portions of the (flawless) Minibosses performance.  It is difficult to describe it in a way that doesn't sound ridiculous, but when I saw the hall lit blue by innumerable LCD panels - GBA SPs, cell phones, and PDAs of various kinds - I very nearly couldn't breathe.    


This must be what it's like at Conifur, I thought, the only difference being that people who dress as animals aren't having sex with the suits still on.  You can produce your technology and hold it aloft in a place where nobody is going to fuck around with you.


It brings to mind Salk Middle School for some reason, where I would imagine that young people of any intellect whatsoever are still tormented for not being idiots.  In this bullshit lunchroom apartheid - a system whose contours are intuitively perceived by those of lower social status - I would sit at tables above my station partially because the agitation of my betters was delicious to me, but also because I was tired of sitting out in some Godforsaken hinterland just because I wasn't good at Lacrosse.  At the Penny Arcade Expo, it was almost more than I could bear to be in a place where every table - every table in the room - was ours.

Now that I can see time does, in fact, continue - even after events of such magnitude that they warp space-time - I can start being excited about the games that find their way to stores.  Pikmin 2 is just such a game - also, people in the second Q&A panel asked for a ""watch"" strip, and we have done as commanded.  


Today, we're going to talk about the Omegathon.  


There are going to be some things about it that change next year, but they're the things that are going to change for every console or PC event:  exclusive areas, far from the Free Play caverns packed with people, reserved in an absolute way for tournaments and Omegathon events.  There will also be seating reserved for people to watch each event, because just as I had hoped, many people came to check out each round - each Omeganaut had their own coterie to be sure, but above and beyond that attendees flocked.  I feel a little guilty because the contestants really were at our whim almost the entire convention.  They were the guinea pigs for a kind of gaming reality show that didn't always run as smoothly as it could.  Hopefully they enjoyed their run at the Omega Collection, but let me make something perfectly clear:  simply being the gatekeeper to a hoard like that is exhilarating.  I can't even envision what it must have been like for Josh Eash of Garrison Titan - eliminated in the penultimate round, on the precipice of such obscene wealth.     


Something needs to be said right away:  The people that we chose as contestants were more than we could have dreamed of.  They were taking each other out to lunch after every elimination.  They're better than I would have been in their place.  I came down to the Tabletop area a little later the first day, and there was a group of four of them still playing Diceland.  I thought, Yes.  These are the people I want in this thing. 


My favorite moment - at least, before the final round, which is rich with favorite moments - was probably in Double Dash, where Tina Clifton and Svetlana Tchistiakova (chee-steeya-ko-va) snared one of the unlikely victories that virtually defines the game.  Twelve players left, co-operative racing mode, the last two cars - four people - get dropped.  They had been fighting for fourth place with another car for three entire laps, when they grabbed a star coming up the last stairs on Daisy Cruiser and went on to the next round.  The place Goddamn exploded.   


You might have already heard that the secret game was indeed Pong, as many of you surmised.  As I told Kevin Potter when he asked me about the secret game backstage, it is a challenge that draws upon primal gaming skills.  As it turns out, it is also a challenge to make that piece of shit work at all, but that's another story altogether - the machine is literally an artifact, you can see pictures of it here.  In the machine dwells a genie who makes the most ridiculous demands for even baseline functionality.  Something we were not initially aware of when we chose it was that it is almost the perfect spectator sport.  Every point was accompanied by a deafening roar.  Sean Celaya took the first two games, becoming Omeganaut Prime and claiming the ultimate collection.  Kevin grabbed a five hundred dollar gift certificate to EB, which is good for him, because this holiday season is going to be one of the most expensive in memory.       


You might even have heard of the ""Bonus Round,"" which involved the proposal of a young man to a girl he had met at our first convention ever.  I have this shit on a DVD and it cranks up the waterworks every time.  


One of the great things about PAX in general (and the Omegathon in particular) has been mentally combing the experience to determine which events have iterated and are gone, and which ones become traditions.  1980's fight music is a keeper, we think.  Secret games are ""go,"" and so on.  Essentially what we wanted to do was create the preconditions for a kind of theatrical gaming presentation, something with a high level of melodrama that you could simply enjoy if you wanted to without having to be better or smarter than it is.  It is fun to be in the crowd when things happen on stage.  And, something I just found out, it is also fun to emerge from backstage when the drums kick in on Europe's The Final Countdown.

We couldn't let the Acclaim bankruptcy go without comment, though we initially let it slide thinking about the ordinary gamers who lost their jobs there.  They don't have anything to do with Acclaim's malevolent Public Relations mongrels, and it wasn't they who hatched the Titty Bike genre either.  Then, we remembered that we have absolutely zero social conscience and love to say mean things.    


I believe that after today I will have decompressed every archive created over the course of the convention.  I appreciate your being patient while I store this data.


We've talked about the Omegathon, as well as the noble Omeganauts that took part in it.  We discussed the convention in general, but I had not yet mentioned the total attendance, because I didn't know:  three thousand sixty, that we counted anyway, on thirteen-hundred and thirty seven pre-registrants.  We hoped for two thousand.  They swept in like locusts - chewing, always chewing.      


I wanted to thank the industry professionals and others who sat on panels and filled the auditorium to capacity several times over.  I was particularly delighted with the Pitch Your Game Ideas panel, though I understand that some people might have found the panelists dismissive.  Trust this: those guys aren't any nicer to me - and when you're ready to pitch for real, you need to find a way to get those designs and your ego separated to a degree.  I think I'm just used to it from working with Gabe in a creative capacity, but we've said things to each other about our ideas that - shall we say - leave no room for interpretation. 


The Red vs Blue panel was pretty much wall to wall people, a fire hazard, and to be perfectly honest those guys probably deserve it.  I've had a couple opportunities in the last couple months to hang out with them, and hopefully they agree that they should be back every year for PAX, so long as there is such a thing.  Next year I'd like to see a store or something you could grab their DVD at, shirts, that kind of thing - people were clearly hungry for it, you could see saliva running all the way down their front.  At least, I think that's why.  Anyway, they were covered with spit for some reason.  A Red vs Blue DVD probably wouldn't hurt.       


I'm told that people enjoyed our panels, which is good, because they are an immense spiritual exertion.  We can produce a facsimile of relaxation on stage, but let me assure you that speaking in that context grips us with terror.  I always imagine that this is the sort of thing one gets used to, but yea, even unto five years of this that theorized state never arrives.  Typically there are tables provided with microphones and whatnot, but we learned at the Ubercon that we really don't like sitting down when we are called on to operate the micaphone.  It seems odd to be in repose when people come to see you, regal somehow.  And, when you're already nervous, removing the capacity to move and work it out just exacerbates it.  


We learned a lot this year, some of it the hard way.  At any rate, the consumer E3 has now been inaugurated.  Why it took two of the laziest people in the universe to get it underway is beyond me, but I have a sense that there will be a PAX long after there is a Penny Arcade.

Robert was about 15 hours into the new Star Ocean when I left him yesterday, and he was pulling off some pretty cool shit - inventing items and securing patents on them for sale across the galaxy, pulling off hot combos and hanging out with nymphs.  He and Gabriel do agree on one thing:  it begins with nearly three hours of merciless boredom, after which point you probably deserve whatever great game might exist beyond that bleak expanse.  One of them said things really start to look up around hour fifteen, and one of them began to roar and paw at the air.  I'll let you guess which is which.    


He picked up Phantom Brave at the same time, so all is not lost.  I'd tell you about it, but it was his impassioned oration that made me go get it, so I'll let him handle the duty.  It was Nippon Ichi's Disgaea that brought him around to tactical RPGs for good, and whenever a new one hits he sort of recedes from the world of the living. 

I've been able to resist Fileplanet's siren song since they began the ""queue"" system you now see on other file sites.  It's true, especially with the advent of BitTorrent, that I don't actually need their service for getting ordinary software.  However, they've been so good at securing exclusive stuff - Dawn of War and Tribes: Vengeance leap readily to mind - that it just gets harder to fight it.  I feel like I have a responsibility (of a sort) to tell you about these things.  And since the betas apparently go out to people who aren't familiar with the fucking Tribes universe while I'm at home jacking off to the Starsiege manual, I sort of have to find my own way.       


Apparently it's available to the wider population now, and I recommend that anyone with some free time get their hands on that binary.  I have played it quite a lot since I got it last week, and my sense of it has changed a great deal.  The first few servers I played on were much like my E3 experience - odd network response and spawning up to my waist in concrete.  I raised my glass to Irrational for managing to somehow resurrect and kill the franchise in one game.  Previously, this had taken two titles.  That seemed like progress.  


Never forget that when these open betas come out, everybody digs out that old P2-450 and begins to imagine that they are The Server Man, ladling out packets via their cable modem to the needy and disenfranchised.  I started joining servers with names I remembered, names almost lost to history, like 5 Assed Money.  If you played Tribes, that's a  name you've seen before.  And it played as good as ever.  Vengeance is missing some things I really liked about the original games, but the feel is absolutely right.   


So, the game that I had initially consigned to the grave, likely out of fear, was before me.  And it was good.  Really good.  It's like with Thief.  They rubbed off the number denoting its coordinate in my beloved continuum, so I don't know how to respond to this new thing.  And, just as with Thief, another interred franchise has returned with swagger and drama.    


One thing that I do constantly is that I keep pressing the L key to bring up my laser targeter, and old standby in the series - for the uninitiated, your beam hits a target, and then your heavy armors see a reticule in the sky at the proper angle for their mortar shells.  That, along with the ridiculously useful Command Screen were the two features that largely defined the Tribes Experience for our group.  Both of these things are gone.  Maybe we were the only ones that used the Command Screen, or at least, used it to the extent we did - no, that's not possible.  We would set waypoints on each other so we could be found anywhere in the map.  Indeed, one of us might stay holed up the basement watching the sensor network, issuing attack orders on enemies as they entered the perimeter.  To me, these are fundamental touchstones of the Tribes experience, and I'd imagine that they're precisely the things people railed against for ""slowing down the game.""  Being able to find and assist my friends, even when geographically remote, is probably what kept us playing so long.        


Player feedback on the game is all over the place, but I see the charge that the game has been altered to suit ""nubs"" frequently enough that I'll respond to it.  This claim is actually from the PR department itself, it is supposedly one of their stated aims.  I hesitate to call it a lie, but is a very useful idea to put into circulation.  The fact of the matter is that Tribes is a hard-core game.  The game has been sped up to a terrific degree.  If you think it caters to new players, I call you an fucking idiot without a moment's hesitation.  The things a master player can do with the grappler and the improved skiing will make it impossible - impossible - for initiates to retaliate.  And that's just in demo - give those guys a couple weeks with the retail.  Wait until a buggy pulls up in front of your base and five heavies pop out of the mobile spawn like some military clown car.  You prancing forum cocks got the speed you wanted, and they took away the game I remember with affection.  I made my peace with it because Irrational clearly loves Tribes, and maintained the spirit - but you guys haven't shut your fucking mouths for four years.  I'm officially done listening to your bitching.       


It is still Tribes, and I find it this pace extremely fun actually - similar to how you can change the rate without changing the pitch.  I still have plenty of suits and loadouts, I love the new weapons, and the four packs in there now are perfectly satisfactory.  What has happened is that the game has been altered to diminish the occurrence of stalemates in CTF.  For us, Tribes 2 had an excitement threshold similar to Soccer - we would play for 45 minutes and you might have one or two caps a side.  There's a case where maybe we were the only ones to enjoy it.  That said, CTF isn't the only gametype.  There are others where defense can play a larger role.              


I can talk for a long time, as I am sure you are aware.  This is a case where I am not going to do that.  Taste and see.

It is a very good thing that we had the foresight to produce today's comic on Wednesday, as I am typing this newspost from the Goddamn maternity ward while Gabriel paces out there in the hallway.   


Bewildered young husbands stumble up and down the hall outside this room, I can see them dangling teddy bears by the paw looking for all the world like lost children.  Sometimes they look over at me and I just shrug at them.  I don't have anything for you, man.  Good job on the fertilization and everything, but your situation is still something I'm trying desperately to avoid.


I showed up at the waiting room with an Xbox and a PS2, just to be certain.  Everyone has seen the ridiculous movies and television programs where harried, powerless men rush madly about, and I determined that this was precisely the type of bullshit that wasn't going down on my watch.  We played Burnout 3 from eleven in the afternoon until nine o'clock at night, intermittently comforting Gabe and being horrified at the workings of feminine machinery.  Pork, Brad, and I set our minds on the acquisition of tremendous destruction bonuses in the crash mode, believing that if we could only amass fifty million dollars and gain access to the Semi, we would have done our part in the day's long exertions.  Friends, it was not easy.  but I am proud to say that we succeeded.


When he told me this pregnancy thing was for real, triumphantly declaring that he ""makes boys,"" I told him precisely what I thought - that any idiot is capable of this feat, and that - in actual point of fact - idiots engage in this kind of thing more than anyone else, which is why it can be so hard to get a decent cappuccino.  I was being mean to him, it's kind of what I do, but he really was describing the most common, most ordinary event on our planet.  There are two ways to interpret this.


The first way is to dismiss it, as I did initially.    


The second way, the way that now seems apparent, is to recognize that the significance of an event isn't necessarily diluted by its frequency.  Consider that we might live absolutely encompassed by marvels and wonders.  I am suggesting that we are up to our asses in signs and portents that we are quick to omit or can't interpret. 


This is not my usual state.  I am making an exception.           


It is my great pleasure to introduce to you Gabriel Aiden Krahulik, weighing no less than six pounds four ounces, born at 8:15 pm on the ninth of September, 2004.

The saga continues.


I've been thinking I needed to set aside some time to appreciate Electronic Arts here the post for biting the bullet and supporting Xbox Live.  I have been somewhat impolite when discussing the issue in the past, but I'm man enough to admit it when somebody else does right and I'm ready to say something kind if I have to.  Luckily, after playing Burnout online, I'm not obligated to do anything of the kind.   


First, a parable:  I am extremely enthusiastic about nectarines.  They're fantastic.  Like all fruit, there is definitely something erotic in their presentation.  I bought one with the intention of eating it.


When they're ripe enough, no cutting is required.  You can just grab both sides and twist - as you might twist a squirrel - and then eat the halves over the sink wildly while the juice runs down your arm.  That didn't happen this time.  What happened is that though it looked fresh enough on the outside, something terrible had taken root in the core of it.  As I twisted with triumph and abandon, bringing a half close to my face, I would see that somehow about fourteen earwigs had been born in the seed, and I had twisted open their dwelling.  The fruit was black inside.  Earwigs were writhing, falling out, clinging to it.  Seeing decay and abundance so juxtaposed I dropped it began to scream as loud as I could.  It's an image that stuck with me, and my toes are curling under my desk just thinking of it.      


If you think you are getting Xbox Live when you play an EA game on the Xbox, what you are actually getting is the veneer of Xbox Live wrapped around the black and infested core of EA's substandard service.  It starts by connecting you to Live, yes, at which point you are shunted into EA's sinister realm of torment.  


For the longest time, my Friends List wouldn't come up.  If you've been on Live awhile, you rely on that list the same way you would the basic server browser in a PC game.  It's that fundamental.  It's a top level culling mechanism that lets me know at least one other person in the game I'm about to join isn't a Goddamn reject.  Since my friends list was empty, it seemed to me that maybe EA wanted me to completely rebuild my Friends list manually, or perhaps build it out of names they had on their own service.  It seemed like a pain in the ass, but I thought that the first step - choosing a lobby specific to a global region, alien to Live - was pretty stupid too, and I acquiesced.  


Searching for Gabe, it crashed my console.  


I restarted, and this time the Friends list came up.  Good.  There's a text mail from a friend of mine, no support for 3.0 Voice Mail, but I don't mind typing in a little message with the controller.  It then tells me the message was not sent.  Not much I can do about it now, I guess.  I head out to the lobby and look for games.  I get another notice saying the mail was sent, which, I mean, that's awesome I guess.  I try to join his game, and get an Unknown Host dialog.  About this time, I get an Invite from Gabe.  I try accepting it, and after eight failed attempts and no response form the UI telling me what happened I decide to join manually from the list.  The game is full, but Gabe turns them out on their ear and I manually join the next one.        


Shit like this happens every time I go in there.  You never really know if it's going to kick you out after a match or keep you in the lobby.  If somebody does get kicked, there's no message identifying it, and everybody just sits there for a while.       


Once you get into a game, and provided it doesn't kick you out even if you are the host, it's about as much fun as you can have online - and I know that's high praise.  Aside from not being able to save and trade your best crashes (which is a tragedy of epic proportions), the only regrettable thing about Burnout 3 really is EA's perverse multiplayer scheme.  That it is worth enduring their fragmented, nonsensical approach to player matching is a testament to its craft and precision.

I don’t think that Penny Arcade is a webcomic. I’m honestly not sure it’s ever been one. For me PA is a diary, and so I hope you’ll all forgive me if I spend this morning recounting a particularly incredible day I had recently.


We arrived at the Hospital at six in the morning on September the ninth, having been instructed by our doctor to do so. We were told that they would “induce” Kara which means they juice her up on drugs that piss the baby off so much he decides to just come out. At 8:00 in the morning my friend Brad showed up and by noon the waiting room was packed. Tycho, Pork and Brad got the Xbox hooked up and Played Burnout 3. Robert spent equal amounts of time sleeping and typing up emails on his laptop. Pork’s wife Stephanie and Brad’s wife Trish would feed me horror stories about babies who crap out of their faces and pee from the tips of their fingers like some kind of sprinkler toy. During the twelve hours Kara was in Labor I would occasionally stumble out into the waiting room to provide updates on her condition. It was an incredible comfort to have my friends just a few feet away playing games and joking with each other. Just hearing them out there was enough to calm my nerves. 


Back in the hospital room I sat with Kara and her mom and waited. We burned through nurses as they exhausted their shifts tending to my wife. Our doctor would stop by and check on Kara every few hours but things didn’t seem to be progressing. She was having contractions but they weren’t escalating to the point they needed to get to in order to have the baby. So around 7:00 pm our doctor decided to go ahead with a c section.


They wheeled Kara into the operating room and I followed behind scared to death. I knew what a c section was, or at least I thought I did. I imagined the doctor cutting a little hole in my wife’s belly and then gently removing the baby as though she was taking a quarter out of a coin purse. What I did not expect to see was a doctor pulling with all his might on what looked like a crow bar in an effort to widen the incision enough for a second doctor to wrestle the baby out. It was like some kind of WWE event with doctors up on chairs and blood everywhere. I looked up at one point to see a doctor up to his elbows in my wife’s stomach and I just about lost it. Kara was still cool though and I figured if she could handle I sure as hell better. 


After what seemed like years I heard Gabe cry for the first time and then I watched them pass him off to a team of nurses on the other side of the room. These guys worked like one of those pit crews you see at a NASCAR event. No less than four nurses weighed, cleaned, checked, measured, and wrapped my son in the space of about five seconds. Then they handed him off to me and that’s when I finally lost it. I sat down with him next to Kara as they sewed her back up and we both just bawled. 


Probably the best part of the night for me was the trip back to the room. I held Gabe and walked next to Kara as they wheeled her back to our room. We came out through a set of double doors and I saw all my friends and my parents lined up along the hallway snapping pictures and smiling. It was the first time that I got to introduce my new family to my friends. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt that good or that proud before. 


It’s been four days now and we’re back home. Mom and baby are both happy and healthy. Kara and I would like to thank everyone who took the time to send us a mail or post in a forum to congratulate us. It feels like Gabe has about a million happy aunts and uncles out there. I appreciate everyone who mentioned that he was born on the five year anniversary of the US Dreamcast launch. I’m not sure if that’s some kind of sign but it seems positive to me. I’m not sure if he’ll even like video games as he grows up, maybe he’ll be into sports. All I know is that I’m enjoying every single second I spend with him right now and I cannot wait to see what sort of person he becomes.

Enter... the Obsidian Spur.


After writing what I did on Monday, you can only imagine my delight when I read that the very next day EA would be improving the situation by installing additional server equipment.  Everyone on my Friends list was playing Fable, so I figured I'd leave them to it - I'll test it later and let you know if things have cleared up.  


Because I only bitched about it and did not tell you why lackluster matchmaking was such a travesty, you might not understand why I spoke with such force.  Given that Burnout 3 wasn't supposed to have multiplayer at all on the Xbox, and given that they probably gave three guys fifteen minutes to implement it, it's possible that I am simply too demanding as regards our finite universe.  The true facts, as I see them:  Xbox Live functionality, and functionality commensurate with what we've come to expect, is as much of a feature of that system as the hard disk, controller vibration, or some other inherent quality.  The trouble is, what I want - for each title to conform intimately with the target machine - is probably wishful thinking these days, when they're trying to deliver a modern game on as many as four platforms simultaneously.  While they are hanging from a wrought iron bar over burning fissure in the earth.  And they are covered with spiders.  The rigors of game development!      


The online problems just served to remind me how great the single player game was, that's why it's 2:43 in the morning right now and I'm thinking I should save this file, get back in there and earn some more cars.  You earn them for damn near everything you do in that game, so depending on the level you just completed you might earn a couple cars without really aiming to satisfy the preconditions.  You can select a menu item and win like ten cars.  Okay, that's not true.  But you do earn a stack of Goddamn automobiles just for racing and having fun, which makes progressing in the game always feel incidental somehow: try to imagine a scenario in which someone paid you twenty dollars every time you had an orgasm.  He just walks in there, hands you twenty bucks, and leaves.  It's that ridiculous.  It is as though this game was optimized in some kind of amusement wind tunnel, and anything that wasn't awesome has either been ground off or obviated with a unique polymer.         


Let me tell you about the online games though, because presumably that's what I've been trying to get to.


Let's begin with Race.  ""Rubbing"" is an important part of any racing experience, and different games emphasize it to different degrees.  In this game, good wheel control is certainly a plus but putting a man over a guard rail and into the ocean is really more what we're looking for in a driver.  Smashing guys and creating a wake of mangled steel for other opponents to crash into is a perverse art with a distant connection to origami.  The hits feel solid, not loose or floaty as they sometimes do in other online racers.  The car impacts in Rallisport 2, for example - a game I love dearly - always have an aberrant quality that doesn't seem correlated to the events on screen.  That's not the case here.       


Added to this you have the Crash/Crush modes.  There are a hundred intersections total for you to unlock, with unique conditions and powerups strewn around - things that will multiply or halve your score, cause your car to explode, things of this nature.  Once a given number of cars has crashed due to your nefarious antics, you are given what's called a ""Crashbreaker"" that allows you to detonate your car, which not only causes additional property damage but also lets you guide your vehicle in mid-air towards other victims or a nearby bonus.  Being able to guide your burning chassis is called Aftertouch, and it can be used in the race modes to put that smoking wreckage right in front of an opponent.  There's three ways to play Crash mode in multiplayer:  one of them, Team Crush, is essentially a cooperative crash mode, where you both start before the intersection and try to create the highest dollar value of damage you can by doing things like hitting tanker trucks filled with flammable liquids near seven conveniently parked passenger buses.  There's a competitive variation on the same idea called Double Impact.  There's also Party Crash, which is an excellent social experience:  up to eight players (or four teams of two) compete for the highest score, and then every player watches the best crash of that round.  It's basically perfect.  


The mode I was most excited about did not disappoint:  Road Rage.  Six players are divided into Read and Blue teams - as the intro screen suggests, Blue races and Red chases, but there's a couple twists.  One, the Blue Team gets a few seconds head start to begin building up ""boost,"" whose function I'm sure is obvious, by driving dangerously - that means cruising in the wrong lane, between oncoming cars, you get the idea.  The Red team starts with unlimited boost, and they are tasked with destroying the entire Blue team before they can drive a set distance.  Any Blue cars which are destroyed in this fashion can no longer win the race, but they do spawn behind the Red team, running interference for their compatriots farther ahead.  Such aggressive driving is required of both teams that there really isn't a moment to consider truth or beauty.  You absolutely need to destroy those cars before they run their course, or you need to run for your life against a bloodthirsty opponent and never stop.


Oddly, unlike many Live titles, you can still talk in the loading screens - that's a big plus.  I won't lie to you:  I cut out half-way through this post to catch a couple rounds of Race.  I'm not proud of it.  I'm happy to say, though, that I didn't see any server weirdness while I was in there.  Playing on the west coast at three o'clock in the morning is probably not what you'd call a ""high load"" situation, unless you were a sardonic systems administrator.  Which - and let's be honest - is probably fairly accurate.

The penultimate entry.


We are about to be drowned in retail merchandise, and so before that black night I want to hold these tiny missives above the waves:



I have played Dawn of War a fair bit in Skirmish mode, both before the recent single player demo and after, and it's nice to see the game tighten up so well in that span.  As for the demo I just mentioned, I'm going to upgrade that to Immediate Download, authorization CG-4334HG87.  The audio alone, filled with roaring voices and discharged ordnance is already the best use of the license on record.  It was often the case that I would perch, as a crow might perch, upon news sites waiting to pick and peck at new Warhammer 40k information in a gaming context.  Did it meet with my satisfaction?  Does it accurately present the regulations set forth by the holy codices?  My thinking on the topic of Warhammer licensing and videogames has progressed somewhat.  As much as it pains me to admit it, there are simply people who do not want to stand around a table in a basement that smells like cat piss, rolling dice and moving figurines in tiny increments for twelve straight hours.  Which is crazy.  But I'm at the point now where I just want people to experience the rich fiction, cool armies, potent units, and painstaking character of that universe - which Relic has been extremely true to. 


If you don't have time for the demo at the moment, at least get your hands on the intro video.  If you can see that clip and then resist downloading the demo it introduces, then you are more man that I am. 




The Tribes: Vengeance demo was also very much to my liking, if a bit short - but at this point nothing shorter than the full retail release would bring satisfaction.  Still playing the online multiplayer demo, still enjoying it, and it's the last time I'll say it but I really do need a way to find my teammates.  Okay, done.  Now my mind has turned to the story they'll try to tell with it.  I really want to see how different Tribes interact with one another.  I had typed in a bunch of other things I was curious about, and then deleted them because it made me look like a complete retard.  I don't know what to tell you guys.  This is my series.         


If you are curious about the history of the Tribes Universe, or if you are a dumb fucker from Firing Squad in need of rehabilitation, please make use of this excellent resource at Tribes Roleplayers.  Beginning at 3350, you can see the events that underpin the franchise - you can click on any of the white text at the left to expand that period, which I desperately hope you will do, because then it won't just be me that does that. 



I usually try to avoid linking these, as doing so implies that I am an optimist, which is desperately out of sync with my role as your hard-nosed intercessor to the gaming industry.  However.  I am also very selfish, and a full suite of Thief 3 editing tools is squarely in my best interests, so here it is:  a letter writing campaign to Eidos, how quaint!  If for no other reason, do it simply to delight in the anachronism!    





You're quite aware that I have a great deal of affection for Prince of Persia, starting at the version I had on my Amiga, going forward, skipping over Prince of Persia 3D, and then liking it again with Sands of Time.  With the next game, ""Warrior Within,"" seeming to focus on a dark sensibility and new combat system, I was kind of afraid that it had adopted a genre switch away from Action/Adventure and excise the platforming and puzzle solving that I've enjoyed up to this point.  The earlier videos they released seemed to verify my fears.  They released a new movie yesterday though, I saw it over at 3D Gamers, which appears to depict a much more balanced experience.  I'd imagine that since the combat was a source of so much complaint in Sands they felt they had to get that message out first, but it's nice to know the elements I liked didn't evaporate for whatever reason.   




After playing a bit more Burnout online yesterday and not seeing any of the odd behaviors that enraged me so, I can now officially appreciate the fact that EA has put a game online for the Xbox.  When their system was caddywompus, it made the fact that they persisted in using their own lobby system another offense in a long list.  Now that it functions properly, I can see it as more of a doctrinal difference.  We both agree that there is a God, for example, and we both believe that he embodies a certain suite of eternal characteristics - we're just trying agree on what he likes for breakfast.

I was worried that when Fable came out I’d get sucked in and I wouldn’t have time to play Burnout 3 and Phantom Brave. So I’m actually kind of glad that Fable was a huge disappointment.


So in Fable you have a very small world divided up into dozens of tiny zones. Each of these zones sufferers from the “you can go anywhere you want…as long as you stay on the fucking path” school of game design. A winding path will take you through each one of these zones and you don’t need to worry about accidentally wandering off the path and getting lost. You’ll quickly notice that someone has placed sturdy impenetrable bushes, broken fences, rocks, and impassable pools of shallow water all along the road. The entire game may as well be played on rails as your options for exploration are essentially zilch. The really awesome thing about these tiny, linear zones is that they require an insane load time. Traveling from one side of the map to the other will require you to spend nearly as much time loading as playing. Thankfully at some point the designers realized that traversing their bullshit world was a real pain in the ass and so they decided to let you teleport wherever you want. I imagine this conversation went something like this:



Girl: “Wow, running around in our game fucking sucks.”


Guy: “What if you could just teleport wherever you wanted to go?”


Girl:  “That doesn’t solve the underlying problem. Shouldn’t we instead address the fact that navigating our game world is a bitch?”


Guy: “We should have sex.”



Whoa, that certainly got hot! In my imagination all work place encounters between men and woman result in clandestine sex.  


Not only do these tiny zones require loading but you also have to load every time you want to use a shovel or a fishing pole. The idea is that there is treasure buried all over the world just waiting to be dug up. However each time you want to dig you need to select the spade from your menu and then wait as the game loads the digging animation, at this point you will either get some treasure or you’ll see your character sigh. Then you get to wait again as it takes you back to the regular game.  I dug twice before I was totally fucking sick of it. 


So what’s going on in-between all this loading? Well you’re playing an extremely linear and limited hack and slash adventure game combined with a shitty version of the Sims mixed with animal crossing only minus all of animal crossings charm and inspiration. If you want to just play through Fable as fast as you can, it’s a boring but passable action RPG. The combat is awkward at first and the camera is frustrating but you can have some fun with it for a couple of hours. Thankfully that’s all the time you’ll need to invest if that’s how you decide to play the game. If you decide you want to buy a house or flirt with a girl you certainly can. You can also spend an insane amount of time dressing and building up your character. In fact a huge part of the game revolves around making your character look awesome. I can see how this might be cool in an MMO where you could show him off to other players but in Fable no one else will ever see your character. You can’t even take screen shots and upload them via live into some kind of online Fable hero’s picture album to share with your friends. You spend so much time in this game working on a character that you can never share with anyone else. I actually saw forum threads in which people were trying to describe how cool their characters looked to each other. They would try and explain how their particular hair cut really accentuated a certain tattoo. These people are so desperate to share their characters that they were trying to take photos of their TV screens. 


In my opinion, none of Fable’s “open ended” game play works in the context of a single player game. Things like owning shops, becoming renowned and impressing people with your sharp dressing just aren’t cool when the world is populated by pre-programmed puppets rather than living people. 


Also if you can’t understand why it looks like ass on your HD television here’s a little trick. Fable will sometimes refuse to run in 480p, but you can force it to by going into your dashboard. Open the tray with Fable in the drive and then go into your video settings in your dashboard. Turn off 480p and then turn in back on. Now hold both triggers and click both thumb sticks. This will force your Xbox into 480p mode and you can just close the drive and start Fable. Now if there was a series of buttons you could press in order to make it worth 50 bucks.

And now, the conclusion of Undisclosed Propensities.  For the longest time, Continuity was something I associated with bad flavors and poor manners.  It most certainly did not come over and hang out.  Hopefully you were not inconvenienced a very great deal by our antics, which have been arrested in the very moment before a holiday software deluge that won't subside for another three months.  Clearly, our services are required.      


I keep trying to play games which are not Burnout 3, and routinely emerge from the experience disappointed.  I pop in the other stuff - Sims 2, CS: Source, what have you - because I feel like I should be consuming a more diverse media diet, but renaissance gamer credentials are simply no substitute for vehicular manslaughter.  If there's something wrong with it, I can't find it.  I'm prepared to call it Game of the Year.


I tend to think that my responsibility to you necessarily precludes utter fascination with a single game, but all that does is make finding such a thing a singular fixation, a fetish.  The way this usually functions is that I will glom onto something and play it with such ferocity that I either discover its deep flaws or simply burn the game out, like a lightbulb, switching it out.  The last game I had this level of devotion to was Rallisport 2, which I delighted in like a consort.  I wouldn't say that I discovered deep flaws in the game per se, but there was a race that took place in pitch darkness on dark brown mud roads that I found fiendish and unnecessary.  I also tend toward seizure by Popcap games, but in this company I never know whether to admit that or not.  I revel in the sheer disposability of them, I think.  I'm just as comfortable spending sixty to seventy hours on a single tactical game or RPG, but disengaging my active mind and urging fish to squeeze a gold coin from their anus is something I heartily recommend.   


I can assure you that I have not oversold my current paramour, Burnout 3 - indeed, I have even withheld information so that there might be something left for you to discover.  For example, I have not covered the single-player events in any real detail, and there is more!  I am your dutiful servant in this matter.  Now, go trade in some Goddamn games and get with the fucking program.

Because I think Star Wars is a ""neat"" series wrapped around a single truly excellent movie, I am not the man you want to come to for the rock-ribbed enthusiast's perspective.  Indeed, I'm more likely to suggest a comic like today's.  I did pick up the new THX-1138 boxed set, which I like a lot, but I like any movie that implies that things could always get worse.


I bought Star Wars: Battlefront yesterday, PC version, and I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.  


There are things you'll see in this game that you desperately want to, have wanted to, for years.  You can look out across a plain of ice and see an AT-AT craning its neck down at you and disgorging bolts of energy.  Well, maybe you didn't want to see that.  You can ride speeder bikes through the woods.  You can drive an AT-ST on Endor and blast ewoks.  I'm not partial to the Episode One period, but I'll be damned if I don't enjoy taking to the rolling hills of Naboo as the droid army and blasting gungans, watching them sail through the air on the shockwave from my explosive device.  It really is cathartic.  There is even a level where gungans systematically destroy your childhood memories, which is cool.      


The first screens released for this game are no longer valid representations of what happens in it - they have added that light, universal glow from Full Spectrum Warrior that is actually a good cinematic match for Star Wars.  That it also softens what models and textures is another plus.  You head out to some place like Tatooine and see that softness cast everywhere on that sand and you start to feel pretty good about where graphics are at right now.  There are amazing science-fiction vistas to behold, as long as you don't get up too close - the geometry isn't anything to get excited about.  It hardly wrecks the impression, though.             


Sounds good so far, you're thinking.  We haven't talked about the AI yet.  The AI is as dumb as paint.     


The fill up the levels on or offline, making it appear visually that you are a member of a grand force.  A grand stupid force, the 433rd Idiot Legion, a futuristic jobs program for social detritus.  You can't be proud of the shit these guys do.  You'd better run your ass right over to those speeder bikes, because one of those fuckers is already on his way and he'll put it to no good purpose.  They don't mind getting out if you want to get in, that's nice.  But the all the livelong day they just do the stupidest shit, and for all the epic trappings and swelling music you are shooting fish in a barrel and that doesn't make a person feel heroic.  When I heard about the special units for each side, the ""heroes,"" I think I assumed that these were player controllable Super Classes that might be earned in some way.  No, they're just more idiots - except it's an idiotic version of Darth Vader or something else you used to think was cool.  Darth Vader in a corner, running, forever running, swinging his lightsaber at enemies which either do not exist or are so small we probably don't need to worry about them.      


It's possible that there's a server out there with No Heroes and No Artificially Intelligent cannon fodder that avoids these complaints, which would create an experience a little more like what we're used to on the PC where there is no shortage of good capture and hold games.  I was pretty excited about Battlefront, you'll soon see the ads I accepted for it in that idyllic period before release - I'm going to try it on one of the other platforms and see if it's a better fit before I give up on it.

I just wanted to agree with Tycho here. I picked up the PC version and it just doesn’t feel very good to me. I’m going to grab a copy of the Xbox version today and give that a shot. Maybe it’s a better console game. As many of you know, I have zero patience for games that do not immediately engage me. If I’m not having fun within the first five minutes I consider it a waste of money and time. Tycho is the one to go to if you’re looking for reasoned analysis and informed opinions. I’m the guy you want for snap judgments and petty complaints. If this were any other game I’d probably be done with it after my experience yesterday. The problem is that I desperately want to like Battlefront. I’m going to spend another day with it, and play a couple different versions before I make up my mind.

412,2004-09-24,"Tiger Woo, Supplemental","
Tiger Woods 2005 continues to obscure the actual game it's based on, delivering an enjoyable (if light) round of mini-golf.  The multiplayer is still a head-to-head, two player affair, which doesn't make sense and further distances the game from its origin.  Of course, it's an EA Sports game so all the bells and whistles are there and production values are very high.  Contrast that with Links, whose level of polish is pretty middling and whose only memorable feature is an excellent round of golf, online or off.  Only one of them takes the game seriously.  I wish those weren't our choices.         


At any rate, Gabriel The Elder suggested a comic about the game and I shot him down, which then became the comic, so I guess I've satisfied your USRDA for worthless trivia.  We don't have time to fuck around, though - there's a lot to cover:  



It is times like this that I wish I were a more vigorous prognosticator.  You have, of course, seen the new ""PSTwo"" - like the PSOne, it is a re-tooled iteration of the system with a much slimmer form factor.  And, as anyone who has installed a Playstation 2 hard disc will tell you, the system is mostly empty space inside.  You could literally put an entire sandwich in there and it would fit comfortably.  Lord only knows what teenage indiscretions have made that secret realm their home.


Anyway, I wish that I had just come right out immediately and said what I was thinking, which is to say that there's no Goddamn way a hard drive is going to fit in the new system.  Well, now we've got verification that this is the case.  The reasoning is great, too:  ""Consumers who want and use the Hard Disk Drive are typically the more 'hard core' gamers, and with more than 27 million Playstation 2 units already sold in North America, we feel that a majority of those HDD interested consumers already have their Playstation 2 units.""  For me, it's not that I'm worried that I won't be able to get one.  What I'd be worried about is developer reticence to incorporate the add-on as a real part of the system and utilize its functionality, marginalizing my investment.  




Unreal Tournament 2004: Director's Cut has tons of new shit, not the least of which is three completely new vehicles and four new maps for its highly engaging Onslaught gametype.  It is essentially a new product at retail, but in keeping with Epic's historic benevolence it is also available for download.  There's a demo incorporating these new features, as well. 





I often refer to E3's Kentia Hall as the Gaming Ghetto, Where Games Go To Die, etc.  You absolutely need to visit it, just to see the low rent publishers with their MMO RPG RTS hybrid spectaculars stacked like cordwood out front of their booth.  I saw one that I wanted to know more about last time, a game called Nexus:  The Jupiter Incident.  I'm partial to three dimensional space-based strategy games, and the glossy pamphlet I took from the booth is actually something I still have here.  You never know what is going to happen to the games you see in that hole, but it's pretty much even money that you'll never heard from them again.  There's a demo for it out now, though - and that's more than I expected.




 is a project a some guys I know are working on, and it's an interesting concept.  Picture what is essentially an IRC client.  Load up whatever game you're playing, and when you hit alt-z it pulls up a chat overlay that is drawn right on top of the game.  The program also has an open plug-in framework for people to extend the functionality, I think it currently has a WinAmp control in there just as a proof of concept.  I'm mostly excited about the possibility of these extensions, as I'm ordinarily not a chat person - but when they start to rock voice support something to that effect, I think they'll really have something great - look at some of the planned features for stuff they have en route.  





Gran Turismo really isn't my series, as I believe I've made clear.  I think of the dark world under the hood of a car as a treacherous and deadly region, and have no desire to modify the things that are in there.  Also, the name is just kind of fancy and foreign.  At any rate, now Gran Turismo 4 doesn't even have online racing, so I guess I won't buy it twice.    





I am really enjoying Stealing The Network:  How To Own a Continent, which is actually the second book in the series.  They are essentially fictional accounts of clever people exploiting security systems of various kinds, using specific details and genuine information as a foundation.  Each of the stories, written by a handful of people capable in this context, is tied together with a metanarrative that sort of has me by the balls.  I don't know that the writing in every case is always top drawer - one gets the sense that they are engineers first, their prose being somewhat pragmatic at times, sentences constructed for a specific purpose by robotic arms under hermetic conditions.  But it is always interesting, it's a huge book and I'm burrowing straight through it with real hunger.  It's a bit pricy, but I've quite enjoyed it, so I guess that's about all I can ask.

When Kara is not generating human beings, I understand she plays a fair bit of The Sims. Outside of Kings Quest VI, it's the only game Brenna has ever genuinely tolerated.  I've played a fair bit of the new one myself, but it's not wrong to say that I mostly watch television.  That is to say, I watch sims watch television, because apparently just watching regular television isn't lazy enough.  I watch television by proxy.  


The primary feature Brenna was looking for in The Sims 2 isn't there, which is the ability to put furniture in the corner, facing a room.  There are hearth configurations she can't manifest in the game, which strikes her as criminal act.  For my part, there's a lot more ""game"" there - in addition to whatever short and long term goals you have established on your own, each sim has a series of wants and fears that need to be managed.  You'll find that these things are correlated a lot, in that you'll have a teenaged sim that is extremely enthusiastic about kissing girls but also mortally terrified of being refused.  Not really anything I need to explain, there.


Everything else just has greater depth:  if you buy a couch, you can choose different upholstery and woodgrain options.  There's a fairly elaborate (at least, by my standards) ""make-up"" option when creating your sims now.  You have absolute control over their facial bone structure.  When you want to cook something to eat, you aren't limited to ""dinner"" or something like that, there are a host of menu items based on your cooking skill.  Anyway, yes.  It's a better dollhouse than the first one, which will either attract or repel you.  That's all you really need to know.      


I've completed the main campaign in Dawn of War, but that doesn't mean I'm particularly dedicated - unlike offerings from Blizzard, which I will admit are almost ridiculously elaborate, Dawn of War has a single campaign which is only ten or eleven missions long.  The campaign hits all the right notes though, as far as the setting is concerned, but I'm really not satisfied.  I don't feel like I wasted my money, I feel like I want another ""helping.""  The game is from Relic as you'll recall - Relic, who gave an entire RTS expansion away for free.  Hopefully they will recall some of that old benevolence and dish it up.


Though the game in the box is already terribly amusing, as a fan of 40k in general my mind has already wandered to the ineluctable retail expansion pack.  It's customary to get a few new units for existing armies in the *Craft games - but there's still so much left in Warhammer 40k to kick out.  The anime-inflected Tau.  The Matrix Space Zombie Necrons.  The Tyranids, which Starcraft players know better as the Zerg.  Relic could also forego a new army, and go the Command & Conquer: Generals route - each of the armies they've already implemented in Dawn of War have, according to the tabletop rules, myriad sects within each to which special rules apply.  I'd rather see a new army altogether, but honestly I'm still so elated that they didn't completely fuck this up that I'm willing to invest a bit of faith in them.

I got a ton of mail from people asking if we need volunteers for Child’s Play 2004. If certain hospitals find themselves overwhelmed with donations and need help sorting through them we may put the word out for readers in that area to help. Unloading all the toys is a big job and if a hospital needs help we’ll let you know. 


I also got a mail from someone telling me that the Buzzcomix forum wanted to help us out this year. This surprised me at first since most of the guys over there really seem to hate us for some reason. I thought that perhaps they had decided to put aside their dislike for PA long enough to support a good cause. I hit the link he gave me and discovered that they still don’t like us very much. One of the guys posting in the thread really got to me and I wanted to address some of his complaints here. He started off by saying this:



“Sorry to wet-blanket all of this, but true chairty can only occur when it is done without the knowledge of others. Otherwise, it becomes a form of ego validation. 

Sticking up big signs that shout WE'RE HELPING THE KIDS is not altruistic in the slightist.”



I understand that at some point everyone turns seventeen and thinks they are smarter than everyone else. We’ve all been there. I’d hate to think of the shit I said when I was seventeen made public and archived forever on the internet. I know that in a few years he’ll look back at this post and shake his head. I still wanted to comment on it htough.

It’s a nice thought but the reality is that if we did this by ourselves we could have given a couple hundred dollars each. However by “sticking up big signs” we were able to raise almost $200,000 in toys and cash. So we’re not being altruistic, do you think the thousands of children that benefited from Child’s Play 2003 would agree or even care? If there was just one guy draining his blood and keeping it in his fridge would that be more altruistic than the Red Cross? Or do you think the Red Cross is full of shit because of the huge flags they fly wherever they go? The bottom line is that the more you promote a charity the more good it can do.

Then he followed up with this post:

“This isn’t like Make A wish or some similar organization. They live it. They do it every day. Where will you, Gabe and Tycho be on December 26th? At the hospital hugging the wee ones? Somehow I doubt it. 

Now I could be wrong, but until I get shown otherwise, this is nothing more than Christmas Charity, ultimately meaningless because it does not show true compassion to your fellow human being. And that's what I find repulsive about these ""acts of compassion"" 

But I think we do agree on one thing, assuming that's what your meaning is: If it takes Christmas charity to get people to break out of their selfish little shells at least once a year, then it's an improvement. But please spare me the bullshit that this is being done for the kids and the kids alone. 

Our culture has taken self-aggrandizement to artistic levels. Wrapping yourself up in a cloak of compassion once a year in the hopes that someone will notice is just a sick twisting of what the true meaning of charity is. 

Anyway, get back to me when this is a weekly event.”

Once again this post smacks of “seventeen-ism”. Unless he’s typing this post with one hand and giving blood with the other he can go fuck himself. You’re telling me that unless I can help someone every single day it’s worthless to help anyone ever? Unless I spend every day at the hospital hugging sick kids I shouldn’t bother trying to help them at all? What you’re asking for is certainly admirable but in reality it’s not possible. I’m not Mother Teresa, I just draw a comic strip about games. The majority of people couldn’t and wouldn’t devote their lives to charity. If we all lived by your rules no one would ever help anyone, not even once a year. Your outlook means that since you can’t help everyone you never have to help anyone. How convenient for you.

People who are fanatically devoted to eviscerating miscreants should investigate Raven's X-Men: Legends.  If they are unable to bring the full four players to bear, however, they need to be prepared for the fact that sometimes Cyclops is going to bite it and it's not my fault.  Bragging about your full retinue isn't going to help us battle the Brotherhood of Evil Fucking Mutants.  That breaks unit cohesion, man.  And units need that shit.     


It's the ""brawler + leveling"" scenario iterated in the Dark Alliance series or Hunter, the sort of thing that makes maintaining three otherwise exhausting friendships occasionally worthwhile.  The graphics are serviceable at best, but the character progression has some nice touches and the roster is pretty robust.  Far be it from me to associate numerical values with human experiences but reviews in the neighborhood of 8.0 seem about right to me.  


I posted it very late, but it's possible that you saw it already:  Valve's Gabe Newell has made the purchase options for Half-Life 2 a matter of public record.  The ""subscription"" option suggested last year around this time seems to have evaporated.  Outside of that, there's a couple things that draw the eye.  


One, while there are currently no retail options that include Day of Defeat: Source - a game we could reasonably have assumed was in development - there are fully two Steam options which include it.  We don't know how much those options actually cost, but it seems like even odds you're better off getting it this way than buying it down the road when it hits retail or emerges in Steam.  That's just my belief, and it's not based on anything.  Well, except common fucking sense.  


Two, and this is the big one, take a look at those asterisks that denote which items will be available when Half-Life 2 is released, and which ones you'll be able to play immediately.  Interesting, huh?


You've probably heard of the legal issues between Vivendi Universal and Valve, and if your experience was anything like mine, everything but the portion dealing with a possible delay of the release appeared as indecipherable dog language.  This is the kind of he said/she said dirty laundry bullshit that I find extremely tiresome.  At any rate, this is what it boils down to, tactically:  Vivendi Universal is absolutely welcome to delay the release out of spite or whimsy or whatever else.  Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong.  Vivendi wouldn't be the first aggressive, overbearing publisher and Valve wouldn't be the first artist willing to bilk their patron: I don't care, and it's not relevant to the matter at hand.  Immediate access to the new Counter-Strike is an extremely powerful incentive to try Steam.  Every moment the release is held back, you have to picture one more person thinking, well, you know...  I would prefer to buy at retail, but I could be playing Counter-Strike: Source right now...  


Digital delivery, man.  It just freaks these people out.

417,2004-10-01,Katahada Damahoocha,"I sometimes hear it said that our comics are nonsensical forays without the post, which is a charge I really don't care about.  It's not true most of the time.  If it were, the comic would look something like this.     


Believing that everything is going to hell and the good times will never be back is very easy to do, and honestly you could make pretty good case for that with the available evidence.  As it pertains to games specifically, it's not uncommon to hear speeches at Internet street corners of the ""end times"" variety, lamentations that something dark has taken root in the formerly pure core of game development and we must endure a century of despair.  Tyrants have seized power.  Just as in an old fable, it is usually around this time that the hero is revealed.      


Katamari Damacy is, in no uncertain terms, the finest 20 dollars I have ever spent on a new game.  


Tell me if you've heard this one:  As the tiny Prince of the Cosmos, you must roll a sticky ball around on the Earth, progressively picking up larger and larger things until your huge ball of garbage is transformed into a star. 


I don't remember where I saw it, it was either at Insert Credit or The Magicbox.  These days I see it in my dreams, as cats, children, and sumos drawn are into my vortex - grist for my inexorable march.  The level usually determines your starting size, which itself determines the sorts of things you can pick up immediately - but the entire level scales to take the size of your garbage ball into account.  For example, I started the level in a public park which had a gigantic clock face in the middle, and by the time I rolled my ball back there the clock was so small I barely recognized it.  You start by rolling over toys, fruit, coins, and cookies and in no time you're grabbing golf balls and cassette tapes, moving up to cats and small chunks of garden fence, eventually knocking little girls off their bikes, and snaring both.  You might start by rolling over tiny eggs in the carton, slowly graduating to larger eggs which hatch and cheep as you acquire them, moving on to sparrows and roosters.  I don't know either, man.          


The multiplayer isn't bad either, though it's hardly the star of the show.  I'm basically mentioning it because if you have acquired more stuff than your opponent, the game doesn't differentiate them from any of the other fluff and stuff that is lying around - you just pick them up like anything else while they wiggle the sticks and try to escape.  That's pretty demoralizing.


There is a extremely surreal hook for the whole thing, a strange storyline being told in cutscenes as well as reams of truly insane dialogue from The King of the Cosmos - highly odd turns of phrase that genuinely appear to be the product of an alien intellect.  In addition, the game is a repository of exquisite music - I've imported music for more than 20 dollars from that expensive island, and none of those had the decency to include a game.  It's getting harder to find, from what I hear.  I can understand why that might be the case.

We did not need to invent something ridiculous about Shadow Hearts: Covenant to prime it for inclusion in the site, that's true - but the game actually knows how ridiculous it is pretty much all the time, and it's right there with you, laughing along.  World War 1 era superheroes who turn into bats and steal people's mailboxes.     


Jeremy Parish (who is a personal hero) wrote a review of the game that should probably be read if you're considering a purchase.  He's wrong about the combat system, in that combos can go to four characters long, which activates an entire class of unique Combo Magic - but really, that's not pertinent.     


Essentially he says that this form of RPG has been done, and done better, which is sort of hard to argue with in a raw production values sense.  Final Fantasy casts a shadow so large that it envelops the entire genre, which is well known.  Nobody does Final Fantasy better - a truism that now includes Square-Enix itself apparently, as with their XII iteration they've shrugged off the iconic turn-based combat and gone with one of these Goddamn real-time hybrids that so appeals to a game reviewer's keen sense of novelty.  This is part of a larger discussion that I have with Gabriel the Elder, and I guess now you can have it, too.  


There are two branches to the discussion, one of which focuses on the mad rush to convert perfectly solid, genre defining 2d games into three dimensional piles of dogshit.  The urge must just be overwhelming, because the results of this process are almost universally reviled.  Gaze ye upon the insulting, monstrous Metal Slug 3D, for example.  It is true that when the Metal Slug series began, technology of the sort used to project 3D scenes like that was not available.  The presumption, I suppose, is that if two Ds are good, then three Ds must be glorious beyond imaginings.  When they sodomize classics in this way, do they think of themselves as selfless intercessors between the technology gods and huddling, primitive peoples?  Do they imagine that they are engaged in a work of unalloyed benevolence?  


As it turns out, just because we can manipulate 3D images doesn't mean that they are the ultimate solution for every task, in terms of the gameplay or in any other kind of terms.  There are still marvelous possibilities inherent in the 2D plane which we have not discovered yet, and maybe we won't ever, because that third dimension draws a man, like a nipple.  When I play a game in the Guilty Gear series or pop in the punishing Viewtiful Joe, I breathe a sigh of relief.  Somewhere, someone was able to resist the siren call.         


The other half of the conversation has to do with these Goddamn hybrid action systems that have come into phase in role-playing games.  Tales of Symphonia is one of the worst games I've played in recent memory.  Star Ocean is a joyless, grating exercise I could recommend only as penance for some grievous moral miscalculation.  Certainly, their stories are caricatures of cliches based on a half-understood mishmash of Western and Eastern folklore, but I have to be honest with you when I say that applies to virtually all content Japan produces.  I can't claim ignorance of it at this point, and honestly the surreal experience of having my own culture digested and projected back into my cornea is one of the reasons I seek the genre out.  But both of them have different takes on this action/RPG hybrid that has bum-rushed the genre, and I'm glad that technology allows us to do things like this, but I have to tell you that I don't see it as a substantial improvement.  I'm quick on the draw and I can push a button in sequence with the best of them.  But there is something natural and sensible and universal about a turn-based system that allows for absolute, explicit position, clear delineation, and genuine decision making.  Maybe that seems quaint to you, but dividing the sequence of play into turns has a validity that isn't diminished by advancing technology.    


Oh look, Shadow Hearts: Covenant is now a footnote in this post, which wasn't my intention.  At any rate, the other points are probably more important.  


My primary complaint with the new Shadow Hearts isn't with the frequency of the random encounters, it's with the content of them - there just aren't that many creatures per area, though thankfully you move from area to area at a fairly brisk pace.  It's been funny and engaging to us in ways that recent RPGs haven't been, precisely because it hasn't been snared by the modern manias that have latched on to recent role-playing games.

420,2004-10-06,The Visionary,"
For his birthday a couple years ago, I bit the bullet and bought Gabe a Tivo.  I did this because, to a very large extent, the parameters of his life were defined by which shows came on at what times.  Certainly being able to manage your stable of programs is a positive, humane development - but the main reason I have it is so I can skip commercials.  Just before I obtained one of the devices myself, I could be expected to scream with all my vigor at the antics which lurk between show segments.  It was essentially a Two Minutes Hate, except where the traitor Goldstein might have been projected I instead railed against Arby's vile, creatively inert Oven Mitt.      


I don't understand why this is exactly, but he is only interested in the time shifting functionality of the machine:  he will let it record shows, and then watch them later, with the commercials intact!  To what end, sir!  Imagine a futuristic shower stall that would store your rinsed off filth for immediate reapplication, and you have come very near the point.  This isn't actually the problem, by the way.  If he wants exposed to Oven Mitts and and other toxic stimuli, fucking have at it.


Here's the issue:  he'll come in to me and ask me if I've seen this or that commercial!  As though there were some virtue in it!  As though he were collecting and arranging small treasures.  As though I had not arranged my life in such a way as to be impervious to their urgent message!  He was telling me about some ridiculous new pizza yesterday and I just Goddamn lost it.  Every minute flap of the pizza industry's delicate wing I am forced to internalize, all because they have gotten their twisted seed in my compatriot.  On that note, it does seem to me that they are running out of places to put cheese.  For my part, I hope they fucking die in cheese.  I will not have my satisfaction until they are boiled away, only fingernails floating on a sea of bubbling white.   


If you've been into EB lately, and call it a hunch but I'd imagine this is the case, you've seen that they have modified the Gamecube kiosk to include a set of bongos where the second controller might once have been.  God love 'em, but I really think they're asking a lot of the young men that come into an EB if they think they're going to go over there and touch that thing in plain sight.            


That's really the trouble.  Donkey Konga is like an experiment I perform on people I know, from the hardcore on down, as I'm of the opinion that the game taps into some pretty fundamental themes.  I have all the shit and four bongos in a box I wheel from place to place like a travelling show.  As long as you can get someone to actually play it, as opposed to just stand there framed in the doorway with their arms folded, you're in for a pretty good time.  The concept it is based on goes something like this:  ""It Is Fun To Clap With Your Friends.""


Now, I know that's ridiculous.  I know it.  But I swear to you on the plot of unturned earth that will one day be my mother's grave that it is true and it is good.  It is true and good and incontrovertible that when you clap with your friends you feel joy.  As a raw game, it is highly amusing and can pack an almost demonic challenge you wouldn't expect from the earlier difficulty levels.  Initially, you might find yourself looking around as you are playing the bongos on the song Bingo.  You are looking around because you are afraid that a girl might see you.  I need you to be strong.         


They had them in Costco when I was there last week, for five bucks cheaper than EB - hopefully they'll carry the bongos solo for cheaper as well.  If you're already enthusiastic about rhythm games, the purchase is a no brainer - but I can't stress enough the tribal unity produced by as little as two and as many as four drums.

-Gabe out

",Johnathan Gabriel,,https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/10/07/
422,2004-10-08,Trajectory,"
One never knows if they should be forthcoming regarding their fetishes, outside of some anonymous room in IRC or in the protected reserve of a convention exclusively for enthusiasts.  I'm beyond protestations of normality at this point.  I will triumphantly open my trenchcoat, and reveal my secret products:  I think Myst is about as good as it gets.


Those of you who tune into these transmissions out of habit or interest will, of course, exhibit no surprise regarding this revelation.  Furthermore, the notion that there might be some mystical form of writing or that books may be written in such a way as to render their contents a portal to the places described...  Well, if you've ever had more books than friends, you know that the statement verges on a kind of truth.  The series itself originated where I used to live, and Myst was literally the first game Gabe and I played.  Of course, these associations lend the series a mighty power, but it also helps that they tend to be very good.   


A hallmark of Myst is that a great deal of what you must do and much of the tone is not made made explicit - you infer large portions of both the game and narrative experience.  Certainly, there tend to be journals around to fill in gaps and sometimes to verify your unmoored imaginings, but I wonder how much of my understanding is flush with official canon.  If you played the first one many years ago - and the likelihood is very high because nearly everyone did, and technology of this kind tends to draw our people in - you might be interested to note that Myst IV: Revelations is practically a direct sequel.  The wayward, dangerous sons of Atrus...  Well, I guess I'll let you find out for yourself.       


I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard that it was an internal Ubisoft studio behind this entry - they're up to the task, but it becomes clear immediately that they are pursuing a different philosophy than series creator Cyan.  Whatever Cyan does next, I feel confident that they will continue along the trajectory suggested by Uru:  real-time, three dimensional worlds rendered impeccably that make mortal machines strain and yip.  When I saw that Revelations was resorting to 2d representations, it seemed quaint until I understood why in fullness.  Similar to Quicktime VR, you can look completely around your viewpoint - except that instead of a static image, you're actually looking at what amounts to (in some cases) a live feed of your surroundings - with swaying foliage, ambient life, and 3d effects applied over the top of it for effects, like arcing voltage or rippling water.  It will also be odd the first couple times you see actual human beings layered into these strange surroundings, as live action thankfully  went out of vogue long ago.  The performances only overreach occasionally I'm glad to say, and in some cases add quite a lot - for example, I think the girl they chose for Yeesha delivers brilliantly.  Even from the introduction, she legitimizes the use of this technique.      


Aside from this augmented 2D I described, Ubisoft Montreal makes two major changes to the formula:


One, the game is ""tactile"" in a way that Myst hasn't explored before.  This is shown in the demo, if you'd like to examine it for yourself - but it manifests in a couple ways.  Anything that is close to you can be touched, and tapping on any surface produces the kind of sound you'd expect.  I don't know how many Goddamn sounds they have in there, but the illusion of touching things in the game hasn't been broken for me yet.  You can tap on a puddle of water and see the effect, etcetera.  The second way they communicate this tactile sensation is that whenever you interact with something, a level, a drawer, a cupboard, a latch, any mechanical object, it is not enough merely to click it - you mouse over it, the hand icon changes, you hold the mouse button down to grasp what you are interacting with, and you move it in the appropriate direction.  The animation tracks both the rate and direction of your movement which does a very good job of fooling your mind.  It seems like a small thing, and it might be.  It doesn't feel small when you do it.   


Two, and this one might be jarring but you are not required to activate it, you get a necklace very early on that can reveal events and dialogue that have occurred in the past at that location.  This interferes somewhat with the inference that is to my mind a hallmark of the series.  Thus far, I've found its revelations interesting and sometimes extremely helpful, but they are optional.  I would imagine that this, like the integrated Prima Guide, is there to help newcomers.  I like being deposited on an alien world with nothing but a disembodied hand to keep me company, but I recognize that this may not be a universal trait.  


The reason you might throw your computer out the window is that this is still a Myst game and some of the puzzles will cause you to re-evaluate your high self-opinion.  Are you smart?  Are you clever?  If you want to retain those beliefs, unsullied by plainly incompatible information regarding your deep faults of intellect, you may want to leave this one on the retail shelf. 


When I got back from the thing yesterday, I immediately set about purchasing the Silver package for HL2 and flying through all the new versions of the classic Counter-Strike maps in spectator mode.  Office actually made me cry to look at it, such was its timeless beauty.  Between the imminent Half-Life 2, Paper Mario, Alien Hominid, Prince of Persia, Halo 2, and the hint yesterday that there might be another System Shock 3 in the works, I hardly know what to do with myself.  Is is as though my prayers took root in the mind of God.

Jesus Christ, sometimes I get the hiccups.  I don't get them on purpose.    


The first day of the Nintendo thing was, as you could probably gather, focused on the DS - but there was free play the next day on every Nintendo platform, and though the coverage of the event was pretty thick it's possible that I focused on some element that someone else didn't. 


Before I played Tales of Symphonia, that and Baten Kaitos made me vibrate with anticipated pleasure.  I like the feel of a wavebird, and even the standard controller is a departure, and so I relish any opportunity to use one for the kind of extended period an RPG promises.  Typically the 'cube pulls Party Game duty, it's rare that I have a real solitary experience with it.  Since Tales of Symphonia is compressed hell, all I have left to buoy that fantasy is Baten Kaitos, and from what I saw at the event I was able to relax as much as I'm capable of.  It's been suggested that I would prefer that all the objects that surround me were replaced with cards representing those objects, with their statistics and unique properties made explicit - which is an idea that Baten Kaitos takes to heart, with its card based battles and inventory.  I had the good fortune of being able to talk to someone who has tested it thoroughly, and I was able to find out some intriguing elements of the combat - like being able to block with attack cards in some instances, using ""camera"" cards that take snapshots of enemies, and put together ""pairs"" and other poker hands for bonuses.  I found a great post in the Nintendo forums by someone who had imported the game, and obviously his experience is a bit more encyclopedic than my brief dalliance with a highly constrained press demo.  You might hit it up.    


Metroid Prime 2: Echoes was there, and they drew attention to the fact that the graphics and lighting had improved in this version, and I guess I didn't really see that.  I'm not trying to be a graphics snob, either - turning away the steaming dish with an affected gesture, exhorting the waiter to direct further inquiries to my open palm.  Metroid Prime looked great.  This also looks great.  They did show us a suit while we were there, a new suit or at least a new take on a suit that was a radical departure from old interpretations and made me excited to begin earning powerups and jolting space pirates with progressively more potent beams.       


A brief note on Metroid's multiplayer:  it's a lot more fun than you're expecting.  Out of the Deathmatch and Bounty modes, we found ourselves pulled toward Bounty where every hit and kill produces coins that you snatch up and run away with.  Unlike Hunters, the DS variant of the series, you can indeed use the lock-on button to center your view on an opponent - but this is no guarantee of victory, as you can easily dodge shots or go into the morph ball which breaks it.  It's not the reason to get the game, but there is a spark there which I disregarded even the remote possibility of.  


Lord Of The Rangs:  Third Age is a multiplatform title, not even locked to the platform we were there to see - but it really needs its own post.  I'll handle that later today.  I'm going to go through the Pikmin entries and fish out some winners.

424,2004-10-12,LOTR: Third Age,"
It's almost midnight, so if I want even a passing chance at not being a liar I'd better crack out that Third Age thing.


I've been meaning to talk about the ways EA has been using Lord of the Rings ever since I saw Battle for Middle Earth at the San Diego Comic Con, and by now of course everyone probably knows every God Damned thing there is to know about it.  Squad level combat, unparalleled graphics, unfuckingbelievable world maps and a crafty UI and resource system.  I would go over there and bother the EA guys at their booth in the morning before the hall opened and it was always one of my favorite parts of the day.   


See, they'd done some neat stuff with the ""franchise,"" by which I mean Tolkien's much beloved work of genre defining and globe consuming power.  They had published some perfectly amusing hack and slash games that didn't overstay their welcome and were released in a timely fashion.  Battle for Middle Earth was something else.  This was the C&C Generals guys with their balls out, motioning passersby to gaze upon them, to gauge the size comparative to balls they might have seen hanging from other games.  They were starting to take real chances with the setting, and when you look at Battle for Middle Earth you get the impression that they aren't sparing any expense.         


Understand that this is a game that looked pretty good, great even, at E3 - but there wasn't really gameplay to be seen.  It was essentially showing scenes from the film rendered in engine, which was a nice effect, but it gave me the impression that safety was still the primary concern.  There was another game on the same demo reel, on the screens right outside the typically gargantuan, ""EA In The Hizouse"" booth that is usually the first thing you see at the annual event.  Wasn't a whole lot to it, but it was clearly an RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy X where your guys were on your side and theirs were on theirs, turns were being taken, and I was intrigued but this was the first I'd seen of it.  I performed the mental calculations and presumed I wouldn't need to pay attention again for another year, two years at least.     


It comes out on the second of November.


I don't think it is going to consume the world in fire and usher in a pure age, but I think it will be a game with a serious story, feature characters set in a world I want very much to explore on my own terms, and be executed in a way that is stylish and technologically savvy.  The game actually winds through the events of all three films, which surprised me - I thought for sure they were already counting their RPG Trilogy money.  It's important to note that the characters that form your core group are not people you already know about.  Your party is made up of the races you'd expect, with the abilities you want desperately to utilize against the ravaging Uruk-Hai - they're similar to the protagonists from the books and films, but have their own motivations and cross paths with the Fellowship on more than one occasion.  Just how vile your opponents are has been captured with their modeling and their striking animation, and the sound - coming as it does directly from a film trilogy costing hundreds of millions of dollars - is applied to the game with grace and strength.  I actually found the audible ferocity of my foes a little unnerving, and the cues which accompanied the more potent techniques I saw were simply perfect.     


Just as in Final Fantasy IX, a friend can plug in a controller and effectively play through the combats co-operatively.  Right now, we're wrapping up (the still excellent) Shadow Hearts so we can start and finish Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne before the second of November.  I don't know if we can do it.  But God Dammit, we've got to try.

As regards today's strip, Gabe waltzes in with startling revelations about Shadow Hearts nearly every day.  He found the Giurnan metablade, which reaps a harvest of flesh.  Oh look, it's the Steel Womb, which renders the wearer impervious to damage.  Time was you could rely on a man not to load the save between sessions.  Nowadays, every time we load it up there's some complete stranger in the party and everyone's pimped out with legendary artifacts.    


If we want to get the most out of these holiday releases, though, there's really no room for nostalgia.  Indeed, there's barely room for the games themselves.  I was shocked to see that Gabe had already given away his Paper Mario 2, as the game is charming and brilliant and precisely the sort of disc you'd be proud to have spinning in your console.  But that's where we've been put, and there's just nothing for it - there isn't even time for the excellent games at this point, particularly in the realm of RPGs.  We played Mario Power Tennis at that thing we went to, perfectly amazing game, smooth and fun party tennis with imaginative, wacky courts and four player minigames on top of it.  I don't know if I'll be buying it.  I know for a fact that it's great, I played it just a couple days ago.  But the only things that survive in this deluge are high novelty and franchises.         


For example, I gave in a couple days ago on Tribes: Vengeance.  I loved the demos, as I said on numerous occasions.  I found myself jumping into demo servers whenever I had a few spare minutes, which seemed to imply that a purchase wouldn't go amiss.  I'd had it in my head that I wouldn't buy it, because as cool as I thought it was they made the TribalWar forums their design document and didn't stop until they had stripped out the keystones of the classic teamplay franchise in the service of some gameplay goal situated outside the reasonable universe.  I'm enjoying the single player game - it's been well written so far, if not always well acted.  It doesn't draw upon the ridiculously established universe like it could, but I'm aware that nobody but me and maybe ConfigSys.boy even gives a fuck.  I knew perfectly well it wouldn't, even as the debit card slapped on the counter.   


This is probably what they're thinking when they make Comet brand gum.  It works like a charm.  The urge to purchase a new Tribes product was completely unstoppable.  I'm an Adbusters subscriber, yo.  I'm all about the metacognition.  And It still worked.    


We are putting the finishing touches on the Child's Play site, tuning up the page for it and fleshing out the five Amazon wish lists with fabulous gifts.  We're going to play the charity game correctly this time, with fancy press releases to grab attention outside of our context and glossy information sheets for vacuous members of the media, so that when they make a story about it they don't mysteriously credit the wrong people less than an hour after they talk to us.  Also, I was going to say that we would paint it as less maverick this year, and try to hold the snarky comments to a minimum - but it would seem I'm already up to my old tricks.

We did go play Halo 2, and they did make us sign something, but it was a while ago - the build we played is the same one all the most recent press was based on.  Talking about Halo is always really complex for me - partly because of my mind, which is a deranged knot of neurotic impulses.  The rest of it is just because we were mean to the first one, for reasons I still maintain, but can't be explained without a certain amount of nuance.


It's easy enough to see, now, that Halo has become some kind of Goddamn cultural phenomenon.  There is no more pristine moment for some people than when they manage to scrape together four Xboxes and four televisions and enough people to fill them out.  Essentially, I've just described a LAN Party, a breed of bliss that is not unique to Halo and certainly not unique to consoles.  As difficult as it might be for me to imagine, the first LAN experience many people have had is through this game.  Their first co-op experience as well.  So no, I'm not startled by the enduring power of it.  I'm no stranger to sentimentality.  


The Single player campaign, well, you know what I thought of that.  The response to those statements was measured in Kelvin.  It was as though we had come out against caramel or something.  Preposterous.         


So when we started attending (and indeed holding) raucous Halo parties, the forces arrayed against us felt they finally had the means to take us down - we had been caught in some kind of lie.  That I would have been let down by Bungie's Single Player experience but simultaneously entertained by their Multiplayer experience doesn't seem like a contradiction to me, but then I am not an idiot.  I do not have fetal alcohol syndrome and my face largely conforms to the ordinary ratios.      


As I said, we have had the opportunity both at E3 and here locally to play the multiplayer component of Halo 2, and people from Bungie have been right there both times and it makes me feel like such a jackass.  Put aside the fact that I don't retreat from my initial statements.  These are the people who labored over something that I compared to crucifying my penis.  They had the equanimity to have us come out and, for all they knew, shit on their new thing.  I just don't have that gene.  I would invite me out, and then decapitate me so I could fuck my neckhole.  We went out there and came back and they didn't even fuck our necks once.  I'm going to call that class.     


I will tell you what my favorite thing about Halo 2 Multiplayer is.  There are things that anyone would like, as holding two needlers and unloading them is sort of its own reward.  Of course, it's nice to have the same power to create your own gametypes that you've enjoyed at home taken online with bountiful new options.  Customizing your character - Elite or Spartan, with insignias you create with an in-game tool - that's appreciated, certainly.  Not my favorite thing. 


There is absolutely no server browser of any kind.


You'll be surprised how liberating this is.  Typically joining an online game is this arduous purgatory state where you finally find a server that has enough room for everybody, but then you join and can't be on the same team, so you play for a while and don't enjoy it until people leave and you can join your friends, at which point fucking Bob disconnects the server.  That scenario doesn't exist in Halo 2 for a couple reasons.    


One, you create a little ""Team"" in a menu before you ever play.  Teams aren't like Clans, they're temporary, but I'd imagine that your teams will be made up largely of your Clanmates in any case.  So, you're there with your allies or quondam foes, the four of you let's say, and as the guy that put together the team you let Halo 2 know you're ready to drop.  It goes out and finds four guys roughly your ability level with a good connection and you're off to the races.  Want a larger game?  Tell it so, and Halo 2 will track down another group of four to match with you, and eight more miscreants for your stalwart band to mistreat.  Here comes ""Reason This Is Good"" number two.  If the server drops out there, for whatever reason but you're welcome to call it cowardice, somebody else is chosen to be the server automatically and play continues.  The upshot of this is that you spend your time playing the game, not fiddling with it trying to coax an optimal experience.  The process I've just described is for official ranked games, that draw from a set of specific parameters to glean better ranking data for the players.  We were locked to this mode the day we played it.  But even in custom mode, there's no ""browser"" as we think of it, if I understood the UI guy I talked to.  You simply set parameters and join games.  


I don't know anything about Halo 2's single player, or, at any rate, I can't tell you.  Probably best to leave it at that.

I just wanted to make a quick note about the wish lists. It looks like the ""show purchased"" option isn't working correctly. You can however look at each individual item and see how many were requested and how many have been purchased. Also you should know that all the videogame stuff is going to be on the last few pages of each list. I know a lot of you specifically want to buy games and stuff.

Lots of you are mailing me wanting to know how else you can help. Well this year we have five Hospitals to take care of, so the best thing you can do is just help get the word out. Let the kids at your school or at your next Lan party know about Child's Play. You are free to use any of the logos or artwork from the Child's Play site if you want to make flyers or posters to put up around your campus or local arcade. Penny Arcade reaches a shit ton of gamers but it doesn't reach all of them. Tell your friends and tell them to tell their friends. If we can get the word out I think we can make sure that all the kids at every single one of these hospitals is taken care of right this year.

429,2004-10-20,Don't Forget Doppelgangers!,"
Like every other Goddamn person bristling out from the Earth, we have our own theories about the events transpiring on Lost.  I think he really might be on to something!


I've been trying to figure out exactly where I stand on Tribes: Vengeance, and those of you playing along at home are probably having the same problem with my oratories thus far. 


You have my initial comments, which are positive.  I voice some misgivings about the omissions to the formula.  Then, about a week later, I discuss the public demo briefly, in largely glowing terms but with a brief suggestion that I am still unhappy with the incisions made to the core gameplay.  Those emotions percolated for a while, growing richer and darker, culminating in my purchase of the game in direct conflict with my actual desires.     


Since then, I've found myself playing the game until nearly four o'clock in the morning.  It seems clear to me now that this was the game people thought of as Tribes, and that the game I played with my friends was something we had sort of ""made up,"" utilizing the command menu to create team waypoints and dedicating a member to mastering the field remotely.  The features we prized most are actually corollary to what's going on here.  And, since the old group reviles the new Tribes almost to the man, those social features we ginned up aren't really necessary for me anymore.  


As a matter apart from ""altering traditional Tribes gameplay,"" something that could be mulled over, grim-faced, forever, Irrational has imagined how things look and sound in Tribes to the extent that these things dragged me into the multiplayer.  You can look at the jet boots on the Imperial light and see not just their stated function, but how they would be stored when not in use and locked away.  That's not something I had ever pictured, and who knows why they would have engineered it to that degree but they have done so.  They took something as fanciful as flying suits and made them into real things.  The sound, too, deserves accolades upon praise upon abject prostration for its ability to do the same thing - not just odd audible stimuli, caricatures of the future, but the way this world would sound.  Stand by a deployable station when the lid is closed, producing a new item to get a chance to see what I mean.  You can hear it grinding and cutting, fabricating.  It could have hummed and we would have gotten the message.  Instead, everything sounds as though someone visited the era with a microphone.           


I suppose I could probably ask somebody over there why they removed what they did, instead of simply applying the devious personas I've created for them.  I'll do that today.


In today's Child's Play news news, my friend Steve over at HardOCP/Hypothermia is holding another raffle for an excellent piece of hardware, and all of the proceeds go to Child's Play.  All you do to enter is just hit up this page for the info, and then donate five dollars for each chance to win.  He made the machine I'm typing on right now, and it is powerful like a wild animal.  I can vouch for the man's work.    


Also, my friend Jon over at Goats is pitching in, too - in case you actually needed encouragement to buy a shirt with a piratical monkey torso grafted to a robotic walker frame.  Between now and Christmas, anything sold from their store fetches a dollar towards Child's Play.

430,2004-10-22,The Game Is Called 'Fumpkin',"
People getting seriously into PC games in the last few years might not have any idea why I speak the name Peter Molyneux with reverence.  You might have picked up Black and White, accidentally touched your animal's genitals and then uninstalled it in shame, not really feeling its flavor.  It would take a very long time to go over with you the Bullfrog era of computer gaming, when having access to an Amiga meant having access to some of the most inventive games ever stored on physical media.  These days, the things I play associated with his name rarely feel like complete games anymore - they're more like half-finished models he used to be really enamored with until he caught the glint of some new fascination.  I got a little of the old feeling watching an extended preview of The Movies at E3, but I don't know if I can let myself be hurt again by that man.  He's secured quite a bit of new money recently, though God only knows what he'll do with it.


I know that I said I would be done with the Pikmin contest at least a week ago, if not more than that - and I would like to pretend that I'm sorry, that would be the right thing, but for a host of reasons I can't even mimic contrition.  There are a few main hurdles, not so much hurdles as giant dams, that have impeded the process.


Someone sent me a picture of their shit


I found that pretty vile.  I don't know what universe you hair-coated mongrels dwell in, but the one I live in - and you should really check it out - is one where when a person tries to give you a videogame, you do not send him a picture of your shit.  Or send me a naked picture of a young man.  Or, and I am not joking, photographs or drawings of your ""Flesh Pikmin.""  When I come across something like that, I seriously considered pawning these copies of Pikmin and putting the proceeds toward a firearm I could use to make myself die.     


Fikmin is the scourge of man


When I said Text Description, I did not mean Pikmin Fan Fiction, or ""Fikmin,"" written from the perspective of Olimar or Louie or a Bulborb or whatever the fuck else.  Multipage treatises where you hold forth on Pikmin culture are one thing, and I did not disqualify you for doing so.  One some ridiculous level, I'm honored that you would expose yourselves to this degree.  Next time, don't expose so Goddamn much.


I understand that your green Pikmin is meant to represent marijuana


You don't have to beat me about the head and shoulders with it.  I must have gotten three hundred of these.  I can see the leaf you have drawn, I'm familiar with the plant you're obliquely ""reefering"" to.  Without going into too much detail, I know why the quick cash option at an ATM automatically dispenses forty dollars.  


That isn't to say that absolutely every entry was an affront, far from it.  But imagine eating a cookie where every other bite contains a human tooth.  Even if you really like cookies, you might wait a bit before returning to it.


In Sculpture, there are some very noteworthy entries.  We have Pikmin of perhaps questionable political views.  We have adorable, petite Pikmin.  We have Nemesis Pikmin, who stalk their foes relentlessly.  There are also the monstrous, alien Pikmin observed on LV-426, as well as slavering undead Pikmin whose hunger is eternal.  Especially compelling was Eyes Five's alluring but deadly medusa Pikmin.  There's also this, the only carved entry, but since it is carved from a human femur bonus points have been awarded.  Simon Fraser attempts to appeal to my affection for Warhammer, but is rebuffed!  That leaves us with Scott Richard's devastating Wickmin composition and Sara Black's mechanized horror, which I can't decide between, so they both win.             


There are some quality entries in Images, too.  Behold the unstable Prikmin, or the delicious Cocoa Pikmin.  The Akira-inspired Supreme Being Pikmin devastates foes - and you will one day learn to fear Tan Pikmin.  There are Zombie Pikmin, as well as Dark Pikmin who growl and shudder in the night while Necromancer Pikmin raise a dead legion in the service of dark gods.  There are Pikmin who you could rightly call ""juicy.""  There are Bondi Blue Pikmin with impeccable taste, Covert Pikmin entrusted with the survival of the free world, and Pikmin whose buds know only hunger.  Consider, for a moment, legendary vampire slaying Pikmin, or Pikmin refugees from other games.  There's also just some Pikmin who don't have much to offer, I'm afraid - and that's sad, nearly as sad as the loneliest Pikmin of all, come to think of it.  Michael Firman covers virtually every other type.  He turned in an excellent performance, and he will win a copy.  However...      

One fellow sent me a series of Pikmin, which I call ""The Derek Jensen Collection,"" that consists of no less than six discrete species.  He's got some cool ideas for how they'd play out in-game as well, and that's something I would like to recognize.  


In the text department, as I've told you, there was much in the way of storytelling within the strict confines of the Pikmin universe.  Before, I might not have thought there was really room for it.  I loved Nick Kloiber's take on Green Pikmin which could be thrown into stacks and used as bridges and ladders - motherfucker gets a copy for that.  On the other hand, Trevor Bab's brooding prose on the topic of Dark Pikmin is so ridiculous that I have no choice but to reward it as well.  I want to live in a world where immediately upon writing a short story about baby plants that hum with ancient evil, you are richly rewarded by a man in a distant city you have never met.

431,2004-10-24,Third Base,"
We had a chance to see The Witcher in an early form in Bioware's tiny, cubicle wall shanty on the fringe of the electronic entertainment expo.  It was tucked into Bioware's presence because the game uses a tricked-out version of the Aurora engine, not because it's an internal Bioware project you've simply never heard of.  What we saw there was, in my view, too early to produce substantive comment on outside of the most rudimentary sort of reflex.  That's one of the things I hate about E3, and the sensation has only intensified the more I attend it.  It's situated out there at some coordinate in time and space, and the pressure to show something unbelievable there is so intense that you see things which are


a) so embryonic that they should be kept a secret, early, raw, unripe,


b) so heavily scripted that it amounts to new millennium digital puppetry, plotted on some distant point remote from the interactive realms we associate with, well, games,


c)  or introduced by some idiotic chirping gorgon with no knowledge of the game or, indeed, of any civilized subject       


that you sometimes wish you could recline on a red couch in a white room somewhere and die.  


Of course, and please don't get the wrong idea, this has nothing to do with The Witcher itself.  It was introduced to me by serious, capable young men who clearly mean what they are doing.  I'm just saying that a person's hard work probably deserves a less arbitrary, less batshit venue for its introduction, the annual rituals of the publishing world notwithstanding.   


To this day, I sometimes punctuate the silence while I am driving or loading my plate at an Indian buffet by saying ""the Witcher"" in an overwrought and ridiculous voice.  On the phone with Gabriel (TE) earlier today I did it, noticing that some new screenshots had gone up over at 3Dgamers.  This lead into a discussion about the name of the game (and the book series, coincidentally) that we found sufficiently ridiculous. 


Brenna and I moved into our first house on Saturday, and it is becoming apparent that there is a skill tree associated with men that I have never invested so much as a single point in.  There is, as well, as a whole range of specialized equipment I don't have, either.  These personal deficiencies have unsealed hideous new avenues of marital strife whose geography is desperate and treacherous.  Let me confide in you that your wife may one day hold forth on the subject of lawnmowing, when you know for a fact is not a subject on which she has any keen insights.  She will hold forth in grim tones as though she were the Mowmaster General, relating with drama and grandeur her exploits versus those despicable forces which conspire against lawns.

433,2004-10-27,Fruit Fucker: San Andreas,"
Rolled into EB yesterday for one of those Pelican system
selectors, the one you could comfortably live inside of, and
situated myself in line behind four young men dressed from head to
daemonic cloven hoof in black.  I mentally flipped through the recent
releases, seeking a series venerated enough to warrant this sort of
adolescent congestion.


When I saw one of them proudly brandish a black San Andreas bandana, it suddenly became clear. 


Like Halo, Grand Theft Auto's foul-mouthed, amoral sagas
have an appeal inside and outside of our core community.  Repelling alien invaders has always had a universal, indeed, a nearly
patriotic quality, but purely terrestrial concerns magnified to epic volume are not without their cinematic power.  The games submerge the player in content of various kinds and challenge them to come out of the experience with the game they're interested in the most.  Speaking from personal experience, my interest in the actual missions wanes almost immediately.  That's absolutely been the case with San Andreas.  I still find the camera, controls, and combat of the console versions to fall short of the series' promise - a promise manifested most surely in their impeccable knack for creating cities which feel real.  That the series has been able to succeed almost purely on the personality of its presentation for as long as it has is a either a credit to its manufacture or an indictment of our collective intellect, and you're welcome to believe whichever one you want to.        


I won't deny that the game has a real shine to it when you start playing, that shine carried me almost entirely through the first two.  I wish I weren't saying this, I wish I was just giving it a 9.9 and clicking okay on the upload script.  No-one would disagree.  There are many ways to play the game, and as I've suggested the personality it projects positively gleams.  The voice work is excellent, and some of the best writing in games today can be heard on the many remarkable radio stations.  With friends over, it's almost like a performance art.  But I don't particularly enjoy playing it, as a game you understand.  I fully expect to be in the minority on this.         


You might recall that the Fruit Fucker ultimately escaped from his island prison, a fact revealed in our crossover with Elf Only Inn.  Things might not have worked out with Megan, but it would appear that he eventually found a stable peer group in Los Santos.  Gabe also worked up a wallpaper real quick for today's strip, if you're interested.

435,2004-10-29,Hoochie Coochie Man,"
I'd say it's better than even odds you've seen the story, either at VE or Slashdot.  The long and short of it is that someone said they liked a couple Nintendo games in their SuicideGirls profile - and, in a parody of the reasonable universe, lawyers bared their teeth.  I have a hunch we're talking about some kind of perverted spider application, an automated process with a bottomless appetite for filth, but it's funny to think tracking down meaningless infractions like this is some guy's fucking job. 


I guess I should say a few things in advance of this discussion.  SuicideGirls is a site where, among other things, girls take off their clothes.  I'm not saying you should go there or not go there.  They've asked to advertise here before, and while I don't have any great qualm with titillating media I didn't know if it was the best match for the site.  It may be that my scheme for rating pornography has been damaged by the Internet, but the site is actually pretty tasteful compared to other sites I have subscribed to, many of which are filmed in barns.  


Now, with the caveat out of the way, I am not without reason:  I can understand why Nintendo as a corporate entity might not want their juggernaut brands associated with teen coochie.  And indeed, if we were talking about photosets with explicit connections to their brands I would be less likely to ridicule them for it.  I can even envision a scenario where a girl might have a Mario tattoo or something, and they might have something legitimate to say in that case, but honestly now I'm just indulging some kind of fantasy.     


At this point, I don't care if it was a spider or some asshole at a terminal somewhere.  When we did our Strawberry Shortcake comic, I was able to come to terms with the fact that there was an interpretation of my country's laws that prohibited what we had done.  I didn't like it, but I could connect the dots and we relented.  This, on the other hand, is merely stupid and evil.  For better or worse, their company is built on these ancient, perennial brands that sprout up again on each new system.  The reason it works is only partially because they tend to make excellent games - they deal gently with those classics, modernizing what they need, and somehow manage to retain a sense of wonder.  But Nintendo's success hinges on the fact that their characters have become cultural icons - and being cultural icons means that we as gamers take an ownership in those franchises.  They're a part of our language and, if you're the sort of person who reads Penny arcade, your culture.       


It's not legal ownership, no - but we're heavily invested in those characters.  Which I guess is a crime.  


Update:  Or, maybe it's not.  Someone at Nintendo figured out this was stupid - BoingBoing has the letter they sent out.

436,2004-10-31,Harroween!,"
Yesterday's spect...  spooktacular can be viewed here.


The extent to which the two lights on my DSL modem have dominated my life is pretty striking.  As I mentioned last Friday, Brenna and I moved into a house, which has been such a trying ordeal that it deserves its own space altogether for the telling and may even become a weekend ritual.  In any case, the dislocation one inherently feels when moving is even more intense when easily half your social and leisure time relies upon the plane of pure data.  I feel like an apparition without it, a core issue which I guess might worry me if I weren't already so distraught about the corollaries.      


Each morning I would squeak down the stairs, not even turning the light on in the dungeon where all of my technology now dwells, and look in the direction I knew the modem to be.  There was a gap between the light for power and the light for the LAN connection which made it look somewhat toothless, and I would gaze into this mouth trying to wish those lights on.  Guild Wars was coming up, and there was only one weekend to play it.  I'd been getting back together with my All-Star Crew to execute fools in cs_office, the long hallway is my domain, and it made me sick to think that in my absence CT's would penetrate it and gain access to our critical hostages - the same hostages that would ultimately guarantee our escape.  I was jeopardizing the entire operation.                  


And what of my news?  Forced to generate my own opinions regarding current events, I would soon deviate from political orthodoxy.  The trips downstairs ceased having that Christmas morning feeling.  The psychic and spiritual weight of the journey was like the casket of a dear friend, the implications as heavy as the burden.  Unable to steal new music, I would fall into a sonic holding pattern around the last refuge - ancient compact discs, like the ambiguous religious icons of a primitive and ignorant age.  I would hold my knees and rock gently to Helmet's Aftertaste.  It would usher me into death, like Charon. 


With a heavy heart I prepared to verify the foregone conclusion.  The third light, past power, past diagnostic, the DSL light, felt a packet move.  From my vantage point, the modem appeared to wink.        


New topic.


I never know if I'm being a bad citizen or a good host when I avoid discussing politics, but at any rate it's a policy I'll maintain.  It has been my experience that no-one is ever convinced by anyone of anything, they simply mold each new fact like a Rubik's cube until it bears the proper ratios, and since I can't suspend physics or do other impossible things I don't see any reason to adopt some other fruitless task.  People frequently mail me about the ""power I have,"" and the great purpose which it much serve, that I am perhaps the Kwisatz Haderach, etc.  I might feel irresponsible if you couldn't go almost anywhere and see naked, aggressive political maneuvers in iteration, marinating in your ideology of choice.  That's simply not the case.

Don't be startled by any biological impossibilities you see on your
way home, bizarre creatures with no rung to cling to in any natural
hierarchy.  They are no doubt a result of the improbability shockwave
generated when we agreed with IGN earlier today.  Hopefully, these
twilight freaks will crawl away and die gracefully somewhere out of
sight.


Under ordinary circumstances, the only time I think of IGN with any
affection is when I've crashed their E3 party and I'm closing down the
bar.  Through a thick curtain of well drinks I would watch a stage decked
with shambling, washed-up hags, and raise a glass - technically, their glass - to whatever unwholesome virtues they revere over there.  I usually feel pretty good about them at that specific point.


The rest of the time, they are our most cunning foe.  They might not be aware of that, but when viewed in this framework their every activity has a sinister connotation.   


Reading the fallout from their Killzone review, though, I felt like we were kindred spirits.  I heard in those strangled mails the same ululation echoed in my own inbox, that howling assembly I must pretend to tolerate in order to play the gentle host.  I'm right there with you, Ivan.  The nicest thing you can say about Killzone is that flies real good when you throw it.  You were way more polite than we would have been.  Indeed, I'm about to show just how impolite we are with a comic sodomizing your detractors.  Don't say I never did anything for you.


Now, one thing they said is true, and I don't mind letting them have it:  sites like yours can't claim that they aren't a part, and a critical one, of the ""hype cycle"" for new releases.  If Killzone was hyped, perhaps even over-hyped as you appear to claim, well, you can't point at Bob and say it was all Bob's doing.  That's something everybody did.  On the other hand, I was there when they announced it as well, and it seemed at the time like a good vessel for the hopes of that system.  But Halo Killer?  Be serious.  There's only one Halo killer, and I'll tell you this much:  it's not on the PS2.      


I guess I thought the ""console wars"" as such were over for this generation, which is why seeing them break the flesh in this way this was startling - like the symptom of some forgotten pandemic.  Each platform has, by this point, manifested its strengths and weaknesses to such a degree that they are patently obvious to anyone who is not in the throes of some orthodox mindset.  Developers can take chances with their games on the PS2 because of the mind-boggling installed base, and it is the RPG enthusiast's only genuine choice.  The Xbox has, in raw terms, the best hardware of this generation and the most robust multiplayer functionality.  The Cube has first party titles of exceptional quality.  That's the whole spectrum.  There's nothing odd or unknown about any of it - and if facts like these inconvenience you to this degree, I can only imagine how difficult your life must be.

Grabbed Lord
of the Rings: Third Age yesterday, and regardless of anything that
is implied by the
strip I'm perfectly happy with it - probably because I know what
it is and I don't expect it to reform the genre.  It is a delicious
electronic pork rind, and I'm going to sit right here on the Goddamn

I can understand if a person likes Lord of the Rings too much

At the moment, I genuinely want what's on offer here - a fast-paced RPG that will let me kick ass on a monster dog.   


Picture something like the Final Fantasy games we compare Third Age to in the strip.  Now, remove that extra bit of subdermal OCD that series tends to foster.  I'm referring to systems that that add that extra bit of richness in exchange for some of your sanity, like a Sphere Grid or job system.  Skills are drawn from simple trees that advance with use.  All items and equipment come from drops or chests, which streamlines it even further.  Even Diablo has a store, and it's considered about as low to the ground as an RPG can get and still be, well, an RPG.  Honestly, and again, I'm just in exactly right mood for it, with the countryside infested by orcs unified by an undying evil, I'm having a hard time picturing my characters haggling with a shopkeeper over some lembas bread.    


I was surprised to learn that Third Age covers all three films - as I mentioned once before, I assumed EA would find the Trilogy Cash irresistible.  The game literally yelps franchise, if you put your ear close to the disc you can hear it.  I'm sure some clever person over there can figure out a way to wring another retail product out of this concept, and I hope they do.  With a touch more depth in the systems and narrative - the natural domain of sequels - they could have something that is a great deal more than good enough. 


On the subject of Killzone, I wanted to make a clarification.  I claimed that the nicest thing one could say about it is that ""it flew real good"" when thrown across the room.  I was being facetious.  That is not the nicest thing one could say about it.  The nicest thing one could say is that the developers have an intuitive grasp of the first-person perspective, and they use it as well as anyone ever has.  Reloading, executing melee attacks, and interacting with the environments are as convincing as I have ever seen communicated visually.  Then, once they managed to put me utterly in the game context, I immediately wanted back out.  The game itself plays like a kind of dystopian Hogan's Alley.

Anyone who is on Microsoft's press list received an email on the sixth of this month, describing with a fastidious precision the sorts of things you can't say in your reviews.  When taken in aggregate, these taboos cover virtually everything I want so desperately to tell you.  Sorry.  On the other hand, I don't have a copy of the game any more than you do - my playthrough was based largely on skullduggery.  Not the leak, you understand, and certainly final code but still not precisely through official channels.  So the release version of multiplayer - the only thing one can realistically depict without fear of reprisals - is a topic utterly outside my knowledge.  So, now I have to apologize again.  I do strive to be useful to you.


The one thing I can tell you is that the game does not appear to have an ending.  Whereas the first game did not end, indeed, stubbornly refused to end, even once the content had been utterly used up, Halo 2 goes to the credits at the very moment the story begins to glow hot with heat.  I didn't believe it when I first saw it, and I speculate that those who are victorious on Legendary mode are rewarded with more - but when I say more, really I mean anything at all.  


It wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't just spent a couple months enraptured by the bees, a feat of electronic storytelling which invested the Halo universe with such life and vigor that thoughts of playing Halo 2 were practically overpowering.  I never know when I'm being reasonable, when the way I feel about something is actually appropriate to tell another person, so you'll have to forgive me for being disappointed that Halo 2 does not even attempt to resolve the epic conflicts it creates.  It's like when you got the really big chocolate bunny at Easter, and all during dinner you imagined what sort of filling might be in there.  It would never occur to you that there was nothing inside it, nothing but nothing, air from the tip of the ear down but there's not a Goddamn thing in there short of your fond fucking wishes.  


I honestly don't know what compels me to tell the truth on my website.  My lot would be much easier for the lack of it.  


They're right to place such strictures on what reviews may describe, but unfortunately that means that I can't tell you some of the cool things that help to offset the odd culmination - and I wouldn't want to steal it from you, even inadvertently.  Suffice it to say that if you loved Halo, or at any rate you did before Todd converted the Xbox into a bong, really more of a hookah I guess, you will almost surely pee on yourself and quite possibly anyone else who is not safe beneath a tarp.  As a gameplay experience, outside of a space of doldrums in the middle, things move with a purpose and embroil you in action setpieces and compelling scenarios that could never have existed in the first Halo - for reasons you'll find out soon enough, in some cases as early as tomorrow night.  The story payload that managed to find its way into the completed game will generated fevered speculation for months.  Stealing enemy vehicles feels better, if you can believe it, than it does in Grand Theft Auto - a game which is literally named after the procedure.  Because the act has not been reduced to an automatic event, you take a far greater degree of ownership in it.  Steal a tank and tell me how it feels to bash a hole in the armor plate, planting a plasma grenade inside to flush the occupant.  You're going to tell me that feels pretty Goddamn good, and you'd be right.  Now, imagine doing it to another person.


Even if you wanted to whimper softly about the ending, you most likely played it in co-op so there is another person there to comfort you.  The true fact of the matter is that I give the two of you one minute of half-hearted rage and denial before you're online on the same box, effortlessly joined to games of your skill level, your twin models emblazoned with bee decals, and all real or imagined transgressions of the single player campaign forgotten forever.  Don't worry, I'll bear the grudge on your behalf.

There is a considerable amount of Halo wisdom to be imparted, and it may take the rest of this week and lo even unto the next week.  I've had time now to check out the multiplayer a bit, though not as much as I'd like - I think I understand the system now at least, which took some doing.   


There wouldn't have been any confusion if I'd just digested the documents they made expressly to ease the process for new players.  I'd even played earlier versions of it, and I still wasn't prepared.  While you can get yourself plugged into an online match pretty quickly if you were already familiar with Live terminology and aren't terribly picky, matchmaking in Halo 2 is philosophically unlike the ways other games accomplish the same task. 


The first time Gabe and I made a ""party,"" I didn't understand the context they meant it in.  I was thinking of it just as a group, or something to that effect - a little clique that we would use as the basis for matching.  Also, I was thinking of the Fellowship of the Ring.  That's one interpretation of it, I guess - the two of us are in there, and at any time we can put ourselves into rotation on the service and get dropped on the same team in a random match.  Or thwart Sauron.        


Here's the other way to think of it, and it makes what they said about ""bringing a social feel to online matches"" really make sense:  When they say party, they mean LAN party. 


While it's true enough that any ""party"" can make itself available to all comers online in automatched rounds, you can treat it just like the guys in your party brought their machines over for some debauched weekend.  Play whatever insane gametype is the jewel of your LAN parties without having to set up a special day for it or extricate pulverized cheeto from the rug.  And, when a few of the people you're playing with need to drop for the night but you've still got a crew that's four or so deep, just put yourselves out on the net and keep playing, no doubt against other groups doing the same thing.      


It's odd when you first start, especially if you're used to PC-style server browsers or classic Live optimatches, both of which make up for their deficiencies somewhat by being highly explicit.  Once you get the hang of this new way, it's startlingly humane and organic in comparison.  


In other news only somewhat related to Halo, that special edition headset they released is a work of Goddamn art.  It came with this review copy of Halo, and I'm glad it did because I'd written it off as a piece of ridiculous extravagance.  It's not.  It's a precision instrument that is much more substantial than the job requires.  I'll buy one next week, and give it away in some crafty and elaborate contest that I make up right there on the spot.

I'd heard the rumor about there being no hard disk in the new Xbox, I've heard the rumor after that where it is suggested that you will store your content on a separate, Microsoft created ""iPod killer"" portable drive as well.  Until Wednesday, I hadn't heard that Microsoft was planning fully three machines.  Actually, we've heard that there are no less than three and a perhaps as many as six new versions of the Xbox hardware - this information is, of course, from our Truth Department.  It needn't be said that this department abhors lies and strives in all things towards greater accuracy.  


It must be said:  I also suggested ""Xbox Rancheros"" for today's comic, which is distinguished from the other models by a tangy southwest sauce and shredded Monterey Jack.  It was right before lunch and I was hungry as fuck.  Cooler heads prevailed.    


You've probably heard there was a store selling Half-Life 2 on Thursday, though I believe this behavior has since been curbed.  It couldn't actually be played is the thing - it checks in with Valve over the various Internets to authorize itself, and they simply aren't allowing that yet.  That doesn't keep me from opening up Steam every now and again to see if Half-Life 2 has moved from the ""Coming Soon"" heading to ""My Games,"" as I'd heard that a broken street date might mean an early release on Steam.  That hasn't happened yet, and I'm sad to say I don't really hold out much hope for it.  If early copies are essentially just round pieces of plastic (as opposed to useful software), and if Valve is in complete control of whether or not the program can execute to begin with, it doesn't seem like any of us will be reprising our roles as Gordon Freeman thanks to some happy accident.  


Ghost Recon 2, Alien Hominid, Metroid Prime 2 and Baten Kaitos all come out on or about the same day as Half-Life 2.  I consider every one of those ""Must Own,"" but Half-Life 2 isn't just desirable along the usual continuum.  I've played three full levels of the game, from wildly different areas, and I can say with very little hesitation that you are not ready for this jelly.


Gabriel the Elder and I sort of got into it over the game, actually.  Before he'd had a chance to play it, he asked me if I thought it was better than Doom 3.  I told him that it would be difficult to say, they were very different experiences, and other content-free equivocations from my bottomless bag of feigned objectivity.  After getting his hands on it himself he told me how full of shit I was, and how I knew all along which one was better.  I replied that, yes, I could have spoken with more precision:  it isn't that you can't compare the two, it's that trying to compare them is meaningless.  The combination of Half-Life 2 the game, the Steam delivery system, and the Source SDK will define a new generation of PC gaming, usher in a golden age of man, and focus the mod community into a coherent beam which punches a hole straight through our notions of professional and amateur development.            


In that order.

I updated the PA Presents page with teaser images for a couple of our new projects as well as a new wallpaper. As you can see we are doing two projects for Brothers in Arms. I can’t say anything about the first one except to say it’s not what you expect. The second one is similar to what we’ve done in the past. It’s an eight page story and tells the incredible if perhaps slightly exaggerated tale of one “Jumpin’ Jack”, a soldier in the 101st airborne.  

You’ll be able to see our World of Warcraft project here in just a few days. The Brady Games WOW strategy guide is set to ship on Nov. 16 and in it you’ll find about thirteen original comics by Tycho and I. Brady came to us and asked us to help them illustrate some of the concepts and rules that players who are new to an MMO might not know about. So you’ll see comics about all kinds of stuff like character creation, in game etiquette and the differences between the various classes. If you’re buying WOW this month pick up the guide and let me know what you think of the comics. It was a lot of fun to do and so I’m curious if you guys would like to see more stuff like this. Maybe even a series of books, “Penny Arcade’s Guide to Game X”. I don’t know, I’m just sort of thinking out loud here.

In other news EA grinds up babies to make their games. Well maybe they aren’t that bad but they do totally fuck over their employees. I’ve heard about shit like this from my friends in the industry for years so it wasn’t a big surprise. What was surprising is that the employees banded together and fought back. It will be interesting to see how this turns out and if it has any effect on the rest of the industry.

I haven’t talked about Halo 2 yet but that’s because I’ve been playing it every night. For me it’s a lot like Halo 1 in that I lost interest in the single player campaign almost immediately but I’ll be addicted to the multiplayer for months. Tycho beat the entire game and he assures me that I’m not missing anything. In fact when I asked him about the ending he swore and kicked over a chair. I don’t really care about that though as what I was looking for out of Halo 2 was an improved multiplayer experience. The addition of Live play along with new weapons, levels, modes, abilities and the possibility of DLC is enough to make me happy with my purchase. 

We used to play Halo 1 every Thursday night out at the Microsoft building with some of the best Halo players on the west coast. Needless to say we didn’t really have any business trying to compete with those guys. We’d go there with our friends and anyone from PA was referred to as a “brick”. The idea being that if one of us was placed on your team we would simply weigh you down. If by some unlucky twist of fate we were stuck together to make our own team we were called “Team Short Bus”. When it came time to construct our Halo 2 clan we chose to go with the significantly more intimidating “Team Inferno”. It’s almost cool enough to mask the terrible shame I feel every time I load up the game.

Here is a little Half-Life 2 comic for you.  I'm writing this post at 11:30pm on Sunday, wondering idly to myself whether the game I have purchased on Steam (as well as the one some readers purchased in stores) will become available at midnight tonight, on the 15th, which is technically the ""ship"" date.  Since it has already been ""shipped"" in a sense, and since most stores have the fucking thing and are just being told not to sell it, the term is absolutely incoherent anyhow.  Basically, I'm wondering if I'll be up doing the same thing tomorrow night.    


Midnight just hit.  So, I guess that's a yes.


I've been jumping online for Halo 2 whenever Gabe gives me the signal, and we've been sticking mostly to custom games as I suggested we might do.  We'll usually start out in something matchmade, but the reality is that at this point you don't really know how long you're going to be sitting there waiting to get joined.  The first few times we used it, it popped right up  - which leads me to believe it's similar to the load related issues Burnout 3 had initially, the ones that disappeared shortly after launch.  As a result, it's not something that worries me overmuch.  I would like a way to do a rematch in games the service sets up, but like I said that's not typically where I spend my time.


Between Team Oddball and Territories, we played several rounds of a gametype Gabe has cooked up on his box called ""Grab Bag,"" which comes highly recommended.  Essentially, it's a round of Team Slayer with random weapons and vehicles.  I'm used to seeking out specific weapons that I have succeeded with in the past and maintaining a fairly strict circuit in team games, but when each of your two weapon slots has some new alien doodad you don't usually grab, you find yourself changing roles every time you spawn.


Anytime I have not been summoned by the Gabe Signal, I'm either botching some home maintenance task or playing Metroid Prime 2.  It ""ships"" today as well, and it pleases me to speak well of the game as I'm fairly obsessed with it.  Retro shocked us when they were able to make a first-person Metroid game that was not only excellent on its own merits but could genuinely adopt the mantle of that much loved series.  To a certain extent, they're not shocking us this time.  All they've done is make another completely excellent first-person platformer with solid shooting gameplay, a unique aesthetic, and a satisfying, traditional progression.  I typically play it until the lack of sleep causes vivid, terrifying hallucinations to enter my visual field.         


Gabe mentioned the EA_Spouse Livejournal last week, and here's the sequel:  a man named ""Joe Straitiff"" has been let go from the company and would like to tell you why.  The people I know who work in the industry essentially destroy themselves creating the games you play, nothing in this document will come as a surprise to them, they fully expect to be smashed against rocks over the course of a project.  I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that what Joe is talking about isn't terribly uncommon.

***** SUPER UPDATE!!!*****


WORD FROM AMAZON IS THAT THEY ARE TESTING A FIX NOW. THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE FIXED SOON. I'M TURNING OFF THE LASER AT THIS POINT. 


*******************




*****UPDATE!!!*****


I CHANGED THE EMAIL ADDRESS FOR AMAZON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POST. SO IF YOU MAILED THEM USING THE OLD ONE, AND IT BOUNCED USE THIS NEW ONE.


*******************



It is time again for me to call upon the awesome might of our combined readership. Today we need to focus the PA laser directly on Amazon. Let me explain to you the problem we’re having with the hospital wish lists this year.


Here's the issue: Amazon sells Amazon inventory, Merchant partner inventory,
and Market (user/small business) inventory. Some Merchant inventory (like
Toys R Us) is shipped out of Amazon-owned warehouses. Some Merchant
inventory (like GameStop and Office Depot) is shipped out of Merchant-owned
warehouses. *All* Market inventory is shipped out of the user's
home/warehouse. The Merchant's system is supposed to be a good thing because the Merchant with the lowest price ""wins"" the buy box--basically the lowest price floats to the top. Too bad this system perfectly wrecks Amazon's
Wish list system.


The problem is that Amazon's privacy policy doesn't allow it to give out
Amazon customer addresses to third parties without the address-owner's
consent. So if you order a game, and GameStop wins the buy box on Amazon,
and you want to ship it to yourself--that's no problem since you're giving
consent to Amazon to pass your info to GameStop. But if you try to order
that game off of a buddy's wish list (or a hospital's wish list), and GameStop
has the lowest price and wins the buy box--Amazon balks because Amazon
doesn't know if your buddy wanted GameStop to have his address. So the order
just shuts down and cannot be completed.


It's fucked up because there's no work-around. The wish list creator can't
specify that only Amazon-owned inventory be made available through the
wish list. And the creator can't give explicit permission that his address be
allowed to be shared. That's the really messed up part: we state the
hospital's address right there on every single page of the (public) wish list
yet Amazon doesn't recognize that fact at all.


What this all means is that if you put a game on your wish list, most likely
no one will ever be able to buy it for you since 1/2 the games on Amazon are
sold by GameStop, J&R, and other Merchants that ship out of non-Amazon
warehouses. Everyone knows that games are the most-wanted items on any
kid's, and most adult's, wish list. Amazon is helpfully preventing Santa from
getting this message.


If everyone writes in and tells Amazon that their system is jacked, then
maybe they'll get a clue, fix their broken system, and stop losing what must
by hundreds of millions of dollars in game sales.


Purchasing games for sick kids is a huge part of Child’s Play. This wasn’t a problem last year and so probably 80% of our donations last year were games. This year it’s really hurting Child’s Play and we need to get this problem solved quick. 
So with that said I need all of you to hit this address 


resolution@amazon.com


and tell them to fix their broken wish list system. Feel free to cut and paste my post here or just provide a link. I suggest we all use the same subject line. Let’s go with “Fix your busted Wish Lists!” 


Get everyone you know to hit them up on this. We really need to resolve this so that we can make this year’s Child’s Play a huge success.

Misbehaving with a game's physics system is one of life's great pleasures.  Don't think about the domination of your species by hostile aliens and their earthly commissars for a little while.  Take a moment to hit someone you don't know with a box of delicious chow mein!  Smash your downtrodden fellow man with a glass jug.  You'll thank me later.          


Managing the role of expectation on a title - or, indeed, discerning when that expectation is present to the degree that it fouls the experience - can be a huge problem.  A regular game costs fifty dollars, give or take.  Steel Battalion ran two hundred dollars when it was first released - if it is not four times as fun as a mortal game, can it be said to have failed?  Daikatana had many elaborate matrices of expectation ensconcing it, that's a topic all by itself, but the fact that it gestated for four years before release had already signaled the carrion birds.   


So what are we to think about a game that has cooked for six years - slow roasting, by any man's reckoning.  In this company, I don't even need to name it.  A game whose arrival is inextricable with its unique delivery method and whose launch was predated by the already mature development suite used to create it.  The forum threads typically have an air of hostile reverence, like subjects discussing a mighty (but absent) sovereign.


I suppose we are lucky, then, that we needn't spend a lot of time wringing our hands about whether or not the game is good.  It is good.  It's so good that no less than three times I have set this post aside for a few more moments in it.  Oh, that's right - I game on the PC because while consoles tend to offer a more elegant experience, the personal computer can deliver worlds of such fidelity and verisimilitude that I can, in communion with it, go somewhere entirely else.     

Apparently people who bought it at retail had some trouble getting their copies running right, it was fixed shortly thereafter.  I'm given to understand that people who ride horses to work or in other ways live their lives discordant with science and reason also suffer because of their strict adherence to anachronism.  Get with the fucking program.  Stop mixing those specious folk remedies and download your games directly from the Intertron.    


Also, Penny Arcade turns six today.  I can think of no better way to celebrate this momentous occasion than to buy a cool toy - something you'd want yourself - for a young person who could use some cheering up right now.

Every big charity always has a fancy dinner and auction. We figure that just because we're gamers doesn't mean we can't get dressed up for one night and act like we're a bunch of fancy high society types. So with that in mind I'd like to invite you to the Child's Play 2004 charity dinner and auction - December 9th in Bellevue Washington. 


Tickets for the event are $100.00 and you can purchase them here. I know that's expensive but keep in mind that proceeds are going to our partner Children's Hospitals. Also let me tell you about the incredible night we've got planned. 


The evening begins at 6:30. Browse and bid on silent auction items while you enjoy hors doevres, wine, and good company. Dinner and the live auction will commence at 7:30.

Tell your wife or girlfriend to dust off her best dress casue your taking her out. For one night we're all going to look fucking sharp.


Dinner menu: Read the following menu and understand that Penny Arcade does not fuck around. When we throw a charity dinner, it stays thrown Goddamnit. Grilled salmon with lemon aioli and crispy leeks served with tomato-herb couscous and fresh seasonal vegetables, or top sirloin steak with merlot rosemary demi glaze and roasted mushrooms served with horseradish potatoes and fresh seasonal vegetables, or vegetarian. The Cherry Balsamic Salad features baby greens with cucumber, toasted pecans, feta cheese and balsamic dressing.

Now that Half-Life 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 have joined Halo 2 and the sequel to Metroid Prime, the dark conjunction can finally begin. 


We dropped by our EB yesterday to sign the WoW guides they had up there, we signed a bunch so if you were interested in one the chances of them having an extra are pretty good.  Signing shit was not our only goal, however.  We would also require a WoW guide of our own, because our stuff is in there.  We would need Baten Kaitos, because it is an RPG with a card based battle system, which stokes the fires of passion.  Chiefly though, and this might be called our ""primary objective,"" we were there to get Metal Gear Solid 3.  


By the time we had finished the second Metal Gear Solid, we had gone quite mad and had begun literally to chew upon one another.  We had lost our civilization and taken on the characteristics of beasts, grazing endlessly on thick shag and producing a sort of call which was said to recall an orangutan fucking an accordion.  When we regained our higher brain functions - or, at the very least, sufficient manual dexterity - we produced the following comic which we placed in our archive, like a head on a pike, as if to warn us away from this franchise should memory and good sense fail us simultaneously.  With the proper course of action made so explicit, we had merely to choose between wisdom and folly.  Precisely how we chose folly in this instance is not entirely clear.


They say time heals all wounds, which isn't actually true.  For example, the simple passage of time can't cure aggravated damage (such as that dealt by vulgar magick) or reverse the effects of magical diseases like lycanthropy or mummy rot.  However, in our case, it was able to make us forget just how long the cutscenes are in an MGS game.  Though not a wound per se, strange sensations are created by them, such as the impression that your brain's mouth is actually agape and hanging open inside your skull.  We were listening to a codec conversation yesterday that was so long, so God damned long, that the entire Earth was destroyed, remade, and our species achieved a level of development commensurate with what had risen before.      


The cold war setting, the expression of a different era of espionage altogether is the main reason I wanted it - and in this, it strikes unerringly.  The idea - the idea, now - of sneaking through natural environments, this also drew me in.  The cinematography is, again, marvelous.  Konami has managed to find a cache of powerful, secret chips in the system and are working them in tandem, like a rowing crew.  I'll tell you true, though:  I don't know if I can endure the game long enough to reveal it in any significant quantity.  The controls don't feel classic at this point, they feel obstinate.  The organic setting and global glow just serves to muddy things I need to be explicit, like enemy locations and environmental features.  You have to want to like it pretty bad, and honestly, I thought I did.  


I must be missing something.  I'll pick it back up this weekend, I will come to it sweetly and with the proper deference.  I will urge it to reveal its secrets.

i don't see nothing wrong

450,2004-11-20,"So many games, so little time.","
First of all everything Tycho said about MGS 3 is right on the money. If you want to know what the game is like but you don’t want to buy it, here’s what you do. Go out into your backyard and lay down in the grass for fifteen hours. Every twenty minutes have a friend come out and step on your balls. That will give you a pretty good idea of what MGS 3 is like. 


Somehow we were able to score an early copy of Final Fantasy 1&2 Dawn of Souls for the GBA. With all the other shit that’s been coming out I’ve only been able to spend a few hours with it. So I can’t give you a full review, but I can give you my impressions of the game so far.


The first thing you’ll notice is that the music is awesome, way better than it should be on a GBA. Also as someone who got into the FF series late, it’s really cool to go back and see how it all started. What’s interesting to me is that all the stuff you expect from an FF game was already present right from its inception. I’m playing FF 1 right now and I’ve got black mages, red mages, crystals and a very familiar battle system. One thing to keep in mind is that these are old games. Don’t expect any flashy summons or crazy special effects. Even compared to other current GBA RPGs it feels simple. Think of it more like a time capsule than a new game. 


If you’ve already played these games you’ll get improved graphics and a new dungeon. From what I understand some of the text has also been tweaked making for a relatively new experience. 


We also got our hands on a DS last week along with a few games. I just don’t know what to make of it. Every time I pick it up to play a game it feels awkward. It’s big, heavy and uncomfortable to hold. 


The Metroid Hunters demo that comes packed in with the system is probably my favorite game. I’d recommend leaving the stylus in the machine and instead using the thumb nubbin. I honestly don’t know what it’s called. It’s a little strap with a plastic nub that fits over your thumb. Using it on the touch screen makes it function like the analog stick on a normal controller. 


Mario 64 DS is also a decent game. At first I thought the ability to play through Mario 64 as different characters was just a gimmick with no real value, but now that I’ve got it I can say it’s actually kind of cool. Even with all the mini games and the new characters it’s still just a remake and in my opinion the DS really could have used an all new Mario game at launch. 


The other games we got are Spider-Man 2, Feel the Magic, and Asphalt Urban GT. Spider-Man is fun enough and I like that they kept it 2D. Feel the Magic is crazy but Kara really likes it. Last night I heard her yelling into the DS and I asked her what she was doing. Apparently one of the mini games requires that you get the attention of a girl standing with her back to you. So you have to yell into the mic to get her to turn around and notice you. Not my kind of game but she seemed to be having fun. Urban GT is a perfectly decent racing game and that’s all I can really say about it. 


Overall the entire DS experience for me has been very underwhelming. The games range from worthless to decent and the machine itself feels awkward. Nintendo still hasn’t proved to me that the DS isn’t just another Virtual Boy. Maybe the next batch of games will do that. With the PSP looming on the horizon they don’t have a lot of time to waste.

Imagine if both outcomes of a coin toss represented unmitigated tragedy.  Then, imagine that we had created a comic about just such a scenario.  


When screens began to pour out of SOE for Everquest II, I suggested that they were leveraging a powerful piece of rendering technology, but what was being rendered was devoid of any life or character.  Flip through the ""art"" book for the game next time you're at EB, stuck in line behind the guy with all the Goddamn trade-ins.  You won't understand why they went through the trouble of binding a book like that.  The images that accompany your standard Harry/Malfoy slashfic resound with more vigor.  I neglected to relate to you a comment I received when I made the original remark, but it's pretty awesome, so here you go.  


I'm surprised he was able to complete an entire mail to me without accidentally inputting some kind of EQ macro.  His assertion was two-fold:  one, that I was incapable of making a legitimate statement about Everquest because I hadn't played it for four years like he had.  Maybe I am a weirdo, but I don't consider myopia some kind of cardinal virtue.  Anyway, he can have that one.  I'd hate to see him bring that kind of dedication to bear finding my home address.    


The second part was interesting though, because it details the vast cataract he had to develop and maintain in order to keep playing his game.  He said that Everquest looked bad on purpose, and that this purpose was explicit:  so that unlike WoW, the graphics would not obscure the rich gameplay.  Also, he noted, the graphics being bad made it so you could invest the characters you created with your own notions as opposed to some (apparently evil) artist at Blizzard who is trying subconsciously to subvert your imagination.  


I have some experience with World of Warcraft, so this is a topic I can speak on.  I did not find my character looking fly to hinder my investment in any way.  I would submit that it is probably not Blizzard's fault if you are so inert creatively that you can't identify with your little analog on the screen.  I loved my avatar in World of Warcraft so much that I actually stopped playing, knowing that they'd just wipe him, no better than the rest of that stale data.  I recognize that makes me the worst sort of beta tester, but it was quite real.  I knew they would take him away.  I couldn't bear to like him any more than I already did.

452,2004-11-23,Child's Play,"I got this letter from a reader named Michael this morning, and I just wanted to share it with you guys.
 
 
 I'm sure you get a lot of worthless thank-you e-mails constantly,
 but I felt like I needed to let you know how great of a thing you are
doing for all those sick kids.
 

  February of this year I was diagnosed with leukemia, and due to
 my
  age (I was 19 at the time), they decided to treat me using the
  children protocol.  Well, I've spent a great deal of the last
 year
  pissed off more than I ever thought I could be, and not even at
 the
  fact that I got sick.  It was that all these kids who were
 barely
  old enough to ride bikes or write were dealing with
 life-threatening
  disease.  Every time I went to the hospital for my treatments it
broke my heart to see a child in pain.
 

  The kids who stay in these hospitals have absolutely nothing to
  entertain themselves.  At the University of Michigan Hospital
 where
  I was treated, there was one N64 with Banjo Kazooie and Mario
  Tennis, not exactly the most extensive library of games.  These
 sick
kids absolutley love playing the games while they are being
 treated,
though.  As I watched them play with game boys and smile genuine
smiles it hit me just what a great thing the Child's Play Drive
you
ran last year was.  I donated last year, and I've given this year
as
well.  I'm trying to get as many people to help as I can,
because
what you are organizing and running is undoubtedly what I
 consider
the most important thing that happens all year now.



Just an update on the Michael's condition, he has finished his eight months of intensive chemo and now he's just in maintinence. He says the cancer has been in remission for a while and he'll be going back to school next semester. We wish him the best and we appreciate the letter.

453,2004-11-24,Twisp & Catsby in:  The Birdsea,"
I really like this comic.  I've maybe admitted it five or six times in our entire oeuvre, but Gabe's art in this one is excellent and my writing isn't idiotic or offensive.  Also, it was an opportunity to do a Thanksgiving strip, even if it is Thanksgiving refracted through the lens of madness.  Other holidays have ways of obscuring their food offerings, with gods and whatnot, and I just find the focus on birds themselves refreshing.  


I need to clarify something.  I've been playing a lot of Gamecube games lately, which is odd, because usually there's nothing to play on it and it just sits there like a bookend.  I had some early calls on games that haven't turned out to be accurate, and it's something I want to rectify.  Most recently, it's Mario Tennis, which I felt you could skip safely when first I played it.  After several days of play, I'm not so sure about that.


It was apparent that it was a quality game, Nintendo's polish in the testing phase is pretty evident.  But until we had clocked a few four player matches, it was not real to me just how polished it was.  This is not a surface coat.  The game is as deep as you want it to be, which is not something I expected to say about Nintendo tennis - the phrase itself denotes simplicity.  There are ""gimmick courts"" that have all manner of weird shit that happens on them, and I'll be honest with you and say that we haven't felt a need to add any ""spice"" to the already excellent, epic matches we've had.  The basic mechanics are utterly entrancing without condiments.


The minigames haven't really held our interest, though the Chain-Chomp Challenge (or something to that effect) is pretty ingenious.  Let me try to explain it:


All four players are on their own tracks, separated from the other players.  At the end of each track, a ravenous chain chomp roars with hunger - a hunger which can only be satiated by delicious tennis balls.  Tennis balls fire out of the top of the screen toward each player, and this part is pretty easy:  hit them into your chomp's maw to score points.  Bombs, too, will fire out - and this is where the choices start.  You can hit the bomb at your chomp, which will turn his red and stoke the fires in his belly, doubling the point value of any tennis balls he consumes.  If a red chomp is hit with a bomb, he busts out of his little pen and starts running after you - you need to hit a button at the bottom of the screen to chill him out with a blast of water.  Speaking of which, spheres of water will also fire out, which you can use to cool down your chomp.  Hitting a chomp with water in his original state will cause him to go to sleep, which means that any tennis balls you feed him will simply bounce off his peaceful countenance.  So the game, and remember there are four players doing this, is a matter of managing your own chomp while trying to ruin everyone else's.  It's a ridiculous amount of fun, and this is just some little side-thing apart from the already superlative tennis.  I want very much to see how they manage Mario Baseball.


I just want to grab them and shake them, these Nintendo people, shake them and say ""please release more of the round things with games on them.""  Then again, if they actually did that, I guess I wouldn't be in for this revelatory experience every few months.   


I hadn't seen it mentioned on any of the sites I frequent, but while I was looking over the latest FAQ at Bungie.net there was an interview with the Red vs Blue guys.  I'm always heartened by their meteoric rise to stardom, it won't be long now until we regain our scrappy underdog status and resume lives of desperation in the margins of gaming culture.

Subject: Where the FUCK is the Metroid Prime 2 review!


See above subject. You guys have said barely a damn word about it.



Tycho already talked about how great Metroid 2 is but I guess I never explained he was speaking for both of us. I agree with him 100%, I think it's an incredible game. 


I don't want to be one of those guys who starts talking about Game of the Year in November because I don't think that's fair. I know most people think we've already seen the best this year has to offer but I honestly have high hopes for the new Prince of Persia. With that said it's going to be tough to beat Metroid Prime 2 and Half Life 2 in my opinion. I have a feeling that for me at least it's going to come down to one of those two games for GOTY. 


Don't forget to come see us this Saturday at the Toys R Us in Bellevue. 


103 110TH Ave NE
Bellevue, WA 98004-5805 


We'll be there with Garrison Titan. They will be in full armor helping collect toys for Child's Play. The event runs from 10am-4pm and Tycho and I will be there starting at noon. Bring your Nintendo DS if you want to try some multiplayer or bring your WOW strategy guide if you'd like to get it signed. 


Also don't forget about our kick ass charity dinner/auction. There's still time to buy tickets. You can read my full description of the evening here.


Word on the street is that the limited edition Twisp&Catsby prints will be available sometime towards the first part of December. We're making 500 signed and numbered laser etched prints. Judging by the amount of mail I get about Twisp & Catsby I'd say they are going to go fast. So keep an eye on the site. I'll give you a link as soon as they are available.

We did not actually surf a hairy wave of hobo spiders.  For reasons unknown to us, though presumably they have something to do with promoting Pocket Kingdoms (which I will now link), we were sent a couple N-Gage game ""decks"" as part of some strange self-flagellation ritual they have going at Nokia.      


I opened my own box with the trepidation on display in today's comic, if not the final result.  When I think about what I would send a person who tried to derail my product launch, the product they brutally sodomized over several months is not high on that list.  It isn't even low on the list.  I would erect safeguards to keep anyone in my organization from inadvertently sending one and subjecting my shit to further ridicule.  But there it was, nestled there in hay like the Baby Jesus.  I don't know why the hay was in there, maybe it's deadly poison hay.           


You might not be aware that some time after the launch of the universally maligned original system they put out another version of the N-Gage that was somewhat more difficult to hate, dubbed the N-Gage QD.  What they did was resolve the biggest problems people had with the machine, namely the sidetalkin' and the ability to change the game in the system without removing the Goddamn battery.  It's the same hardware otherwise, which has thus far meant that it's got just enough juice to make developers overreach and indulge their 3D fantasies without any real consummation.


I didn't play very much Pocket Kingdoms, as you can see on the competitors page they set up for the pre-release event.  They shouldn't have sent me that thing with Prime 2 and the sequel to Half-Life so close, and I feel no shame for initiating triage.  The only nice thing that can be said for my rank is that I'm higher than Scott Kurtz, who is ever my cunning foe - this brings me joy.  That said, I played it enough to know that now the N-Gage was a real platform, because it had finally acquired its excellent game, perfectly matched to the system that will slip right under the radar of most gamers.  The sleeper hit.  It's a rite of passage.          


In a nutshell, you build armies to scour the land and destroy opponents online.  Armies consist of four slots, which you can fill with units of varying kinds.  Some creatures take up multiple slots, and equipment - both purchased and player created - helps to further distinguish a given group.  The game does not take itself seriously, which I wasn't expecting - the common tongue in this universe is a combination of leetspeak and lines from rap songs, which makes sense once you understand that it is essentially a parody of gaming communities.  The game itself is by Sega as I understand it, and it's also available on Japanese phones.  Minus the Eminem, I'm assuming.  To put it clearly, the game was a real surprise.  I'd imagine the simultaneous sigh of relief by N-Gage owners could move a galleon.    


Gabe actually uses the N-Gage QD as his personal phone now, and the irony nearly peels off my skin.  The reality is that they have made an excellent phone that is kind of a half-ass gaming rig - at least, and this is what I'm realizing, for the kinds of games they keep pushing.  Pocket Kingdoms is a quirky multiplayer strategy game that doesn't really make sense on any other platform.  Look at Pathway To Glory, another strategy experience that plays to the actual metal of the system.  Are they finally figuring something out?  That they have created a platform with strengths and weaknesses, and that development can accentuate one of those and downplay the other?  I'll be God damned.

Gabe has no idea what he's missing with his adherence to the Light Side, as anyone who went dark in the original Kotor is aware.  I was not prepared for Bioware to allow some of the things I did, or at any rate caused to be done, and I hope with intensity that Obsidian will indulge us to the same degree in our depravities.  


I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel about the sequel to Kotor being delivered so soon after the first one.  My stated position is that I am ""cautiously pleased.""  I'm not worried about the jump to another developer, which is something I could certainly invest a lot of paranoia in.  In about a week, we'll see if my faith in Obsidian will pay dividends, or if - like Troika - they're a cadre of talented individuals with massive ideas for whom technical excellence is an elusive quarry.  


I hadn't pre-ordered World of Warcraft, which I recognize was unwise.  Typically I respond to shortages at retail with a lot of feral behavior, but I just didn't have it in me.  On a lark I walked into the Best Buy across the street, and saw that stock of the game was so high that bored employees had made a kind of fort out of the boxes and seemed prepared to live out their days within them.  I carefully removed a section of the rampart and congratulated myself on a surgical shopping experience.  I had to re-grout the kitchen that night, something I suggest you energetically avoid, but I was unable to install the game and for a couple days I was largely inured to your plaintive cries.     


It is simply true that sometimes we whine about things which are not, strictly speaking, things - or, at any rate, they are not things that merit a sternly phrased online petition.  When I heard that there were problems with the launch, I had a hard time even believing it was true - here is a game that had the cleanest beta I've ever been a part of, a beta you could actually play, much as one would an actual videogame.  When I heard that servers were, in all seriousness, making you pay to wait in line because they had failed to plan properly we determined that it was well and truly on.  Then, over the course of the Thanksgiving Holiday, they doubled their capacity and robbed me of an opportunity make stark, declarative statements.  I could make them now, but it just wouldn't be the same.  There are still servers down, many at last count, but I don't think it's for lack of trying.   


I can't avoid the genre, because I've always had a suspicion there would be a game whose ability to translate my person was so complete, whose mechanisms were so natural that I could just sort of live there instead.  Picture a man sipping each milk in the dairy aisle, on the grounds that he will one day come across a mislabeled magical elixir.

I had a lot of people mail me and ask if we'd do an online auction to coincide with our dinner/auction. Well I've gone ahead and done just that. 100% of the proceeds from the following auctions will go directly to Child's Play.


""Der Hornen"" - original artwork and print.


Our Jesus is Fucking metal T-Shirt is far and away the best selling shirt we've ever made. That leads me to believe that there are a lot of fans of this comic strip out there. Well now is your chance to own the original artwork for this comic as well as a signed color print.


""They Possess A Startling Aray Of Features"" - original artwork and print.


It's difficult to maintain our underground cred when one of us is accepting huge checks from publishers in exchange for favorable reviews. At least he spent his money on something worthwhile. 


""Hot Future Girl Can Stay"" - original artwork and print.


Hot video game characters and violence. What more could you ask for in a Penny Arcade strip?  


""Twisp & Catsby in: The Birdsea"" - original artwork and print.


We created Twisp and Catsby because we were trying to make something that no one would like. They ended up being two of our most popular characters. This is their most recent strip and honestly my favorite T&C appearance.


""Alternate Lifestyle"" Parts 1 through 5 - original artwork and prints.


This is a big one. We don't do story lines very often.  However we did spend five strips investigating Gabe's love of golf as well as his relationship with Hector his caddy. This package includes all the original art from each strip in the series as well as prints of the finished comics. 


So there you go. Please remember that all the money from these auctions is going directly to the Children's Hospitals. Feel free to e mail me if you have any questions.

The thing I don't understand about that ""Ten Super Evil Games"" list that's going around - outside of the obvious, of course - is the glaring omissions any modicum of research would have revealed.  There is no mention, even in passing, of ""The Sodomizer"" for the PS2.  And yet again, parents' groups have overlooked the Wifebeater series, neglecting to mention Wifebeater III altogether.  Also absent with no purpose or explanation are Violencing and Kill For No Reason.


I am very sorry indeed that I did not detail for you here my final impressions of Metroid Prime 2.  I said that I would, but then I got Pirates, which absolutely incarcerated my mind.  I'd better not go into it right now, or I'll never satisfy my mission objective.  Let me table the topic by suggesting that Pirates has a sticky tongue, a very sticky tongue indeed, which it can whip out and draw you in to an entirely new category of moisture. 


Outside of an inexplicable, insulting, and ridiculous backtracking endgame scavenger hunt that made me seriously consider quitting to spite them, Metroid Prime 2 has some of the most solid gaming moments this year.  It's the kind of game that makes you pine immediately for a sequel, wishing you could just...  I don't know, flip the disc over inside the machine and obviate the anticipation phase altogether.  They didn't change the control scheme, there's none of the dual analog stuff that other shooters have used to such ergonomic effect.  Many of the worlds they posit in the game are beautiful - Gabriel would love to take in those worlds with the more intuitive ""look"" stick other first person games take for granted - but it wasn't a dealbreaker before, and you shouldn't let it impede you now.  


How Retro manages to make Samus Aran - a character who never talks, and who isn't really seen until the end - so engaging and even human in that Chozo suit is a feat of digital puppetry.  After two games of this type, I'm ready to see how far they could take her - a game based entirely on 2D gameplay, recalling the origins of the series?  Myself, I would like a much more elaborate story - revelations, twists, and genuine dialogue.  I think it could really work.  Back to Echoes, though - that's a sign of a game that really got its hooks in, when I start fashioning the followup right here in the post.  Highly reccomended.     


I'm picking up the new Prince today, and there appears to be something of a consensus in the reviews I've read.  It sounds like the game has not entirely forgotten itself, but that things were lost in the premeditated grab for the mass market.  It's not what I want to hear, but it so clearly mirrors my worst fears that the notion has already taken root.   


Child's Play:  Now that we are in December, you'll see direct links like that one to this year's drive in each post.  I think of last year's $250,000 mark as a kind of ""score"" I guess, and as is the natural inclination of our people we have dedicated ourselves to besting it - but we need your help.  To that end, we have put up a range of original art for auction whose value has thus far exceeded our expectations.  There are still seats available for this year's schmancy charity dinner and auction, which takes place on the ninth.  Steve from Hypothermia is kicking off his third Child's Play raffle this year, throw in five bucks and you might come away with a thousand dollar gift certificate to CompUSA.  Of course, there's also the Wish Lists themselves, whose amusement payload is directed squarely at young people with great need of it.  We'll have the first pictures this week, hopefully - in the meantime, do your bit and bury those hospitals in toys.

The Prince is back, apparently from rehab.  He is beset on all sides by improbably garbed whores.  The good news is that game we liked is in there, but it's underneath a bunch of crap I ordinarily wouldn't touch without gloves. 


Brenna refused to believe it when I told her that the plot revolves around the Empress of Time, who lives on the Island of Time where the Sands (all together now) OF TIME were created.  All the same, that's the kind of situation we're talking about.  Jesus Christ, people.  Just call the island fucking Chronos or something.  Spell it with a K if you have to.  I can figure out that there's some kind of time thing going on.       


I don't have a problem at some default level with the thematic change, my aversion to the new palette (visually or conceptually) isn't automatic.  They just want it too bad.  What's more, I think they're confused about what kind of personality they want the prince to embody.  The PC demo you can download has another voice take for the game's introduction, which painted him as more ""desperate"" and less ""x-treme.""  I preferred it.  It's hard to prefer this Prince in a general sense, though, because (as Eurogamer put it) he's just not likable.  The wry voiceovers and endearing progression of The Sands Of Time's rude royal son charmed me completely.  I oversaw his redemption in the first game, apparently so they could take what I had done and negate it.     


They've got these Raider guys that are essentially the Cannon Fodder of Time, jackhole pincushions there explicitly for you to puncture.  They're mean or whatever, but they don't turn into crows or explode which makes them fairly mundane by Warrior Within standards.  The problem with these guys is their voices, which are hilarious, and not grim.  You can't feel tough when you cut these guys.  Halo has those little grunts, and I guess I'm supposed to feel like a bad-ass when I destroy them but I actually just feel like an asshole.  They both seem like races that just fell in with the wrong crowd.  What they need are compelling after school activities, not death. 


There's a new combat system now, but there's also way more combat, and it takes place all over, so whether or not it actually ceased being repetitive I couldn't tell you.  Just as in the first one, I traverse the combat oriented areas so I can arrive at the next perfected, genre defining platform section.  It is like getting a ordering a pizza and getting a free walrus.  Even if the walrus were excellent, I mean truly exemplary, I'm really not in the market for it and it's not why I ordered the pizza.  


I recognize that electronic entertainment is a business, but at its best you don't see the ravenous, mercantile hunger throbbing right in front of you.  It's indecorous.  You can go read the 8 and 9.0 reviews out there if you want to see it glossed over.  Sometimes, when you play it, you remember how good the first game was.

Prince of Persia 2 is a good game in spite of the fact that the developer tried to ruin it. It's like they did their best to burn the entire thing to the ground, but enough of the foundation remains that it's still recognizable. What that means is that the fundamentals of the first game are so good they can withstand being covered in layers of disgusting music, hack writing and monotonous combat. 


The clever, quick witted prince with the heart of gold has been removed. In his place is a cookie cutter brooding tough guy with zero personality and a handful of poorly written and often repeated one liners. I remember the comic book industry went through a similar phase in the early nineties. The success of books like Spawn lead publishers to believe that kids wanted dark anti-heroes. This lead to the creation of some of the worst comic book characters in the history of the world. Not only that but existing characters where retooled to be darker and more mysterious. For God's sake they gave Super Man a black suit and I think for a few years Captain America's shield drank human blood. Darker isn't always better, especially when you've already got a character that people love. 


The Prince isn't the only character who will ceaselessly bombard you with shitty dialogue. No, you can expect the same treatment from just about every poorly conceived enemy you encounter. The ""Balde Dancers"" apparently quit their jobs as phone sex operators but can't quite give up the lingo. They'll comment on how they ""like you in this position"" or how much ""pleasure there is in pain"". I've actually had to mute my television during some battles just to keep from throwing my chair through it. The best line is probably from the Time Bitch who appears in today's comic strip. During her fights she says ""I grow tired of this!"" I actually responded out loud to her on multiple occasions, ""Yeah, me too lady!"" 


I guess people complained about the combat in the first game not being deep enough. They even said the final boss was too easy. These people didn't understand the game. Your enemy in the first game was the environment. You were battling against puzzles not monsters. The actual combat was there as a breather to give you a rest between puzzles. The final boss wasn't even the vizier it was navigating the last level without your sword. The level was the boss, not the guy at the end. So now they've beefed up the combat and they make you fight all the time. So they listened to the people who didn't like their game and totally fucked those of us who loved it. Thanks Ubi, you know a lot of people really hate all the sneaking around in Splinter Cell. Why don't you give Sam a dual Uzis and a rocket launcher?


The game is still a good platformer despite Ubi's best efforts to destroy it. It's just sad to see a game that had so much potential ruined like this. My only hope is that since the series deals with time lines we haven't seen the end of the Prince from Sands of Time. I'm not finished with Warrior Within yet but I'm praying that as the story implies he'll die at the end.

Holiday memories for you to cherish.  


I have agitated in my household through various means to authorize the purchase of a ""Pod"" coffee maker.  It's possible that you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  I'd be happy to explain it to you.  Might take a second.  


I'm not sure why I felt the need to prove the validity of the machine to Brenna, but the pressure was there.  At around fifty or sixty bucks, Pod or ""Single Serve"" coffee machines are situated in that sub one-hundred region which occupies a unique conceptual space, like a radical new form of matter.  I feel entirely comfortable making any number of purchases one hundred dollars or less.  For some reason, that is below the radar of retail wisdom.        


On occasion, I will even step up to a new videocard or something a couple generations older than the current flagship line, as when a component hits the five hundred dollar mark, a new sort of logic takes hold:  at that point or higher, the purchase might as well be infinity dollars.  It's too high to make sense of and the prospect freezes my heart.  This is why I build my own systems, you see.  If no component breaches the five hundred dollar mark, the cost is (conceptually) nonexistent!    


A videocard, though.  That's going to go inside my computer, which is a place of mystery and terror for Brenna, just as her womb represents mystery and terror for me.  It's not something that is going to come up in polite conversation and I'm certain she won't discover it.  But there is something inherently ridiculous about these coffee machines that I knew would not pass muster, and for that reason I craved her imprimatur.  Essentially, they are small machines that produce one or two cups max and utilize sealed coffee bags, ""pods,"" instead of loose grounds.  It is often the case that my geeky, early adopting ways punish her for selecting me.  Damage control in this circumstance would necessarily be mission critical, as anytime she entered the computer room she would have to lay eyes on this consumer totem. 


It took three months to bring her around, and if there was a way to plot the vectors of our discourse the presentation would fucking amaze you.  I would largely shoot my hands into the air and shout ""Pods!"" believing that the way forward at this point was self-evident.  If she wanted to drink dirty water in a cave, cool, but I wanted to sip exotic blends in a chrome and ivory future.  She is highly resistant to technology, and (as I have suggested)`believes it to be a force for evil in the world.  Indeed, when things do not function as advertised, she seems to think of me as being in some loose alliance with Technology, attributing to me its global havok and congealed human woe.  


I think it was the Black and Decker model that initially gripped my mind with such passion. $It is a coffee maker with a bolt action, like a rifle.  I pictured myself behind  enemy lines, pulling frothy cups of coffee, drawing the bolt back in a smooth action to eject the spent grounds.  I had read a guest editorial over at Engadget where the author eventually decided against machines of this type because each one has a different size ""feed,"" locking you into a specific manufacturer's product.  I was not dissuaded.  I was taking the reins of my own life!         


My father once left to get groceries, and came back instead with a steel runner sled.  There is something fundamental in that decision that has informed the rest of my life.  


So I came back with a Senseo when sent out for something else, a saw I think.  Don't take that to be an endorsement, either of the Senseo or sawing, that's just one of like six brands - and set it up on my computer desk's scanner tray.  This is precisely the way I want my life to work, I'm thinking.  I'm over in Westfall fucking up the Defias Brotherhood and absentmindedly I command the machine to produce me some Goddamn coffee with my extended ring finger.  Inside the box, they even have two bags of their custom ""Douwe Egberts"" pods, ready for me to try.      


One always imagines that evil outcomes will always have explicit portents.  We have been tricked my cinema and`literature into thinking the ground will crack prior to some hideous event.  For the record, this is not true.  It's not true at all.


I am not a coffee snob, I don't think.  And my personal theological coordinate argues against the existence of sin.  But this machine, or at any rate the coffee cartridge you lock the chamber on, it sins against coffee.  It sins against tongues, it verifies the existence of evil.  Robert Folger himself could not have devised a taste more foul, even with the use of a laboratory and an electronic supertongue which could taste in the ultraviolet spectrum.  It came with a ""mild"" roast and a ""medium"" roast, which present a wild inversion of expectations.  Imagine that mild and medium are points in a continuum of hideous mouth crimes.  The Mild is actually the only potable version, precisely because it tastes less like their product's theoretical maximum!  Medium tastes like the mud in which dead men lie.  I haven't even bothered with the Dark roast, whose flavor`I imagine is somewhere between devil piss and liquid gonorrhea.   


Suffix:  You really can't afford to be without these videos of the PSP on Play Asia - the red UI is so bold it is very nearly brash.  Also, and stop me if you heard this one, the guys who wrote and directed The Matrix Trilogy are a band of fucking liars and thieves.  It does make the reckoning more complex, though - who precisely are we supposed to detest for Revolutions?  We should always strive to see that our hatred bears the proper attribution.

The Wing Commander movie was an act of shocking violence.  But at least it was set in space, and there were space cats.  That's all I wanted.  Don't go watch it, and whatever you do don't let the DVD touch your bare skin.  I'm just saying you can't expect even the most rudimentary commonalities anymore.  If the movie were made today, it would be set in New Jersey.        


I remember being excited when I learned that Metroid had been optioned and was in some minor way associated with Johnathan R. Woo.  After having my affection for the series recently refreshed by Retro Studios, I'm pretty sure I don't want anyone making a movie of it.  To execute it properly, that series would take a much lighter touch and a more calibrated aesthetic than a ""House of the Dead"" would.  The experience is so personal that trying to externalize it would be incoherent wherever it wasn't simply bad. 


In today's Child's Play update, we've been receiving the most unbelievable art contributions from people for the last couple weeks leading up to our charity auction - but we got something yesterday morning that robbed me of language altogether.  It's clear that it was Halo related, as it looked to be an AI construct, and originally I thought it might have been an interpretation of Cortana.  That's not what it was.


It was Melissa.  The Op.


If you weren't a Beekeeper, it's simply a striking piece of visual work.  If you followed the bees, and I know that many of you did, the picture is alchemical in nature: it catalyzes a state change, shifting her laterally from figment to being.  You can see the image if you like, it's over at the artist's site.  Allen has prints of it as well, along with his other work - and fifty percent of all December purchases go to Child's Play.  I think you kinda know what I'm getting at here.

I hope that I'm not the only person who applies 3.5 Edition rules to virtually every facet of my life.


Last night was the charity dinner/auction for Child's Play, which went off basically without a hitch.  This is almost entirely due to the help we received from volunteers tightening up the event, and those volunteers were drawn exclusively from our Enforcers at PAX who helped make that a success.  Those guys have us covered every time and I hardly know how to respond to it.  They deserve a   somber, featureless monument.  


We had tuxedos and everything, but the level of dress in general was very high.  There were no ""basement casual"" stalwarts determined to represent genuine gamer attire, which I appreciated.  


Some of the auctions themselves were pushed into the stratosphere by humans ravenous for what we had on offer - it turns out that a young man will pay as much as eight hundred dollars to go to Bungie and get beaten down by those guys in Halo.  Two men fought hard over an ornately framed Twisp and Catsby print which eventually went for over a thousand dollars.  Bidding to see yourselves represented in a Penny Arcade strip was ""off the chain"" from the word go, and it was eventually decided that (once bidding had gone past 1200 dollars) we would simply perform the service for any person (or group of persons) willing to donate a thousand dollars to Child's Play.  To be at the helm of something like that was overwhelming.  All week long I have been waiting to fail in this endeavor, to see no item breach the five dollar mark and see people come away with super elaborate items at fire sale prices.  That did not happen.  


G4/TechTV was there to film the event and interview us, which I found terrifying.  I'm really nothing to look at.  Aside from that, I harbor primitive superstitions about cameras and their evil power.  I don't find the production of language all that intimidating usually, but I'll be God Damned if I can project the most fundamental concepts with a device of that classification present.  I really enjoyed talking to them when the camera wasn't on.  I believe this link has the show airing info.  For the love of God, don't watch my part.  Focus on the left side of the screen where Gabe is, because apparently their devil machine doesn't have the same deleterious effect on him.  


There's still other sites kicking in for the cause, if you'd like to help but aren't sure how.  For a long while now, Popcap has been donating a dollar from each sale and will continue to do so until Christmas.  Eric Burns of Websnark fame is offering to snark for hire, here is his blog about it and a link to the pertinent eBay auction.  My friend Zach from over at Shaw Island put up three art auctions a few days ago, and this is the last chance you'll have to bid on those.  These are just a few of the places helping out this year - the partners page lists each one and what they've committed.   


You might be curious just how much money the dinner brought in.  All told, the night produced $17,000 dollars.  My mind automatically breaks that down into ""Standard Game Units,"" groups of hundred and fitty dollar donations that (in aggregate) have the power to purchase over a hundred systems.  One night, a hundred systems.  I find this ratio satisfactory.

467,2004-12-11,video killed the radio star,"
This year we had a couple different PR companies offer to help us spread the word about Child’s Play. They get us interviews on radio stations and in newspapers all over the country. Since Tycho is generally much better at that sort of thing it became his job to take all these interview requests. He’s been doing one or two of these a day practically for nearly a month and so I figured I should step up and take the next one. The next one as it turns out was with a Seattle radio station 100.7 the BUZZ on the BJ Shea show. 


Apparently the place that set this up for us made the interview for noon but then forgot to call us until a few minutes after 12:00. So they called us and said someone needed to call the BJ Shea show right away which I happily did. A guy picked up the phone and I said, “Hi, my name’s Mike and I’m with the Child’s Play charity. I understand someone there wanted to talk with us on the air about what we’re doing this year.” Then this is what the guy says to me “NO! You wanted to talk to us! And you're twelve minutes late!” I could see that things were not off to a good start. I apologized and told him that someone on my end dropped the ball. I said I understand if it’s too late to do the interview but I was just told to call and I didn’t realize it had been scheduled for noon. He told me that the host was super pissed off and he wanted to know why I was calling so late. I really didn’t know what to tell him besides what I’d already said. I explained again that someone on my end must have screwed up and I said I’d find out who it was and speak with them. It was apparently too late to do the interview so I hung up and figured that was the end of it.


Later in the afternoon Tycho got a call from a friend of his who happens to listen to the BJ Shea show. Apparently BJ talked for 45 minutes about video game playing bums who are too lazy to get off their asses and do what they’re supposed to do. He even made it the topic for the call in portion of his show. 


So I just want to say to Mr. Shea that last night about two hundred video game playing bums got off their lazy asses and raised $17,000 for the Children’s Hospital, and they did it in the space of three hours. In other words, we really don’t need to take any shit from some guy who was too ugly to get on TV.

468,2004-12-13,"The Sony Syndrome, Part One","Recently, I've begun to think that my periapt of proof vs. gadgets has begun to wear off as their lure has intensified.  I need merely examine Gabriel's genuine cravings to throw my own occasional twinge into relief.   


I'll talk more about Sony Style the magazine on Wednesday - I don't believe it's in production anymore, sundered by the same international laws that govern deadly weapons.  On the whole, this is a good thing for Gabriel's eternal union.  He did own the Sony Glasstron, as you might recall from the strip.  The Aibo bit is, I'm sad to say, also based in fact.


I honestly don't know what he was thinking there.  I believe that, at one point, one very specific point in time, he may actually have had enough money to get one and put in the order.  Then, and this must have been quite a revelation, he came to understand that everything he purchased drew from the same money.  He cancelled the order in time to pay his rent and other things which were not electric pets.  


Pod Coffeemaker Update:  The idea is, I think, that only a complete fucking idiot could not produce a hot beverage with these devices.  Indeed, I have heard this derogatory comment on the finer messageboards.  For the new people, it involves putting a packet of coffee in the machine and then pressing a button.  Just now, two minutes ago now, I did it wrong in two completely separate ways. 


I'm actually using tea in there, those Republic Of Tea bags are essentially the same idea, and they work great - but here's how I managed to (not) do it.  The first time, I did everything correctly, and hit the button.  When I reached up to get my infusion, I realized that I had not placed the cup beneath the spigot and so no tea was captured.  The second time, instead of putting the tea inside the machine, I put it inside the cup and placed it in the proper location.  Hot water was produced, and this water went down into the cup and technically did produce tea.  That's really beside the point.  I have a fancy machine that does this kind of thing for me.  I didn't avail myself of it so I could steep tea like a common peasant.    


Child's Play:  Kiko has dropped an inspired design for the charity this year, and he is passing the proceeds on - take a look around his site and see if there's anything else you might like.  Zach's three auctions brought in over five hundred bucks, which is nearly three and a half Standard Game Units.  We're coming down to the end of it - we'll still be managing the influx in various ways for a month if last year was any indicator, but if you haven't donated yet please grab a toy from the lists this week.  We're still waiting on some pictures from various member hospitals, but when they don't come in I just assume that a wall of toys fell on their camera guy and now they can't find him.

Things have certainly taken a turn for our heroes!  Fear not, dear readers.  I have faith our rollicking conclusion will satisfy readers in general - and homosexuals in particular.


I can always eulogize Sony Style, and I'll probably get around to it Friday.  I was on a plane twice yesterday, and I'm not sure but I think that at some point I attended the Spike TV Video Game Awards, so I should probably transcribe those hazy visions.  Robert and I went down there, I don't remember why Gabe didn't fly as well, but I understand that he's pretty focused on his new rogue.  We got out of here at noon and we came back at midnight, which is itself a kind of ridiculous feat whose effects I may never recover from.  Airborne pressure appears to be stored up beneath my molars, piping from time to time like a calliope.    


I think that it's well understood that the realm of live television is the realm of artifice.  However, I propose that it is one thing to feel reasonably assured that it is a construct and another thing to literally behold a hangar full of its mechanical guts.  The awards show itself was a relentless, punishing spectacle punctuated from time to time by odd exchanges, strange victors, and product placement.  


I do not hold it against them that they did not feature gamers of the sort that I would recognize.  I have no interest in seeing a person who looks like myself on television.  At the same time, I think there may be a gaming culture and a gaming aesthetic that is definable and does exist.  The musical elements of the show I found immensely entertaining, but I did not recognize or resonate with the lion's share of what was happening.  This is something else I don't hold against them.  I think that the process started by Sony's Playstation is now one hundred percent complete.  I think that what has happened is that we are no longer relevant.  Gaming culture has been seized, reconfigured, and commodified and programs like this are just the taut skin over a pulsing boil.


If we wanted to catch our plane, we had to cut out early - which meant skipping the ""afterparty"" said to feature the prince of the dirty souf, Ludacrisp.  There was an image of him on the ticket, and he had been modified with Photoshop or perhaps Goo to make his left arm large and imposing, like a fiddler crab's.  At any rate it seemed like a  a dangerous arm and it's probably for the best that we avoided it.

Alright.  So, a couple things happened.


One, the Sony Syndrome ""story"" is probably over.  We're fond of this as an ending place for it, but we your comic masters are mercurial and delight in misdirection.  One never really knows.  We promise nothing, and you should expect nothing.  Nothing!


The second thing is that the Spike event sort of put me off of awards for the time being.  Just as a random comment, if your 2004 awards program does not include Metroid Prime 2 or World of Warcraft, it has no authority whatsoever to coronate the king of any genre.  I'm not even saying that those games need to win.  I'm simply stating that the games exist and are real, news which has not reached them out there on the ragged periphery of taste and intellect.  It has been our annual tradition to list the twelve most delicious games of the year here at Penny Arcade, and though the odds of us telling you our favorites are actually quite high doing it the way we've done it for the last few years really sounds awful to me.  To both of us, even.  So we're not going to do that.      


What we are going to do is present a very short children's book concerning a celestial alignment which awakens the doom that lies dead and dreaming in R'lyeh.  The first page can be found here.  Ia!  I'm sure you'll agree that this will be a great deal more fun for everyone involved.  It goes until the 27th of December, the Monday after next.  This is the cover.       




Child's Play:  Kiko's Child's Play Shirt is, like his other work, a stunning act of design savvy.  He still has a few left in the run, if you'd like to climb aboard.  We're coming up on the end of this year's drive, and I have every faith that when we incorporate the gifts from the partner sites last year's high score will be defeated, and we will enter our initials. 


Please consider what the games you enjoy could mean to a young person staring down a long-term illness.  If you haven't given yet, it's possible you don't know:  you're entirely capable of heroism.  The barrier to entry is surprisingly low.

I know you can buy video game shirts from a bunch of different websites now but Gameskins is special. I like Kiko's stuff because his designs are so fucking solid. I mean honestly I'd hang some of his stuff on my wall if he made prints. Any jackass with Photoshop can take the mushroom from Mario and slap it on a Shirt. Kiko's work is original and powerful and that's why I love it. Anyway check out his new Blood Code shirt as well as his Fighter91 Tee. 


I'd like to thank Slashdot for hosting today's comic strip as well as the cover for the project. We got hammered yesterday thanks to a big article in the New York Times. The server is still limping along as I write this, so if you're having trouble seeing the comic you can hit Slashdot. I wonder if we can Wang Slashdot? 


I'm getting ready for my trip back home to Spokane for the holidays. I've packed a bag full of stuff to keep me occupied in that wasteland of a city.

With all this stuff I should be able to fend off boredom as well as avoid interacting with my family for at least five days. ""Merry Christmas, I'll be in my room.""


Hey Tycho, did you know the new Kingdom Hearts game on the GBA is card based? Usually you tell me about every game that has anything even close to a card based battle system but I never heard you talk about this one. Well in KH not only is the combat based on cards but you actually construct the world map and its levels with cards. I'm telling you man, if you played this you'd shit yourself and then pass out.

My friend Jason over at eToychest kept trying to convince me there was quality there, but I wasn't ready to hear it yet.  Gabriel liked the original PS2 game in import form but watched the shine come off in our native translation, and I pictured that experience migrating to the GBA with lesser graphics - the action/rpg/menu hybrid thing which clearly foretold games like Star Ocean III and FFXII.  No, it's cards.  And cards, as it is well known, help the medicine go down.    


II.  Suprnova - a site which acted as a kind of torrent aggregator, at least, when it was up long enough to aggregate torrents - is apparently down for the count.  Given its past performance, you may not know right away.  Eventually you will come to crave some vulgar new pop single and you will have to go without.  That is, until you go to another site which aggregates torrents and your larcenous rampage continues unabated, and perhaps even intensifies because you have gone without for a brief period and have begun to ""feen"" in earnest.   


Let us turn to Bop-A-Mole as a means of exploring this problem.  The moles come up, and then the moles are struck with mallets.  In this case, the people striking the moles have hired teams of people to suppress these creatures, and they have even invented an unwieldy ""Meta-mallet"" that can bop even theoretical moles.  It is their firm belief in this and other matters that bopping is the mathematically optimal response.  Diverging from the metaphor somewhat, as a practical matter these ""moles"" have become ever more sophisticated and clandestine as a response.  This would have happened anyway of course, but just as the injudicious use of antibiotics creates devastating and unstoppable pathogens these applications will reach a true apex of distributed power, jamming a spigot into the very heart of pay media.         


There are conversations to be had about the morality of file sharing, but until those stern words are able to project a ""morality field"" that causes those in their radius to behave honorably such dialogues fall into the ""adorable but irrelevant"" category.  The muscular responses to the phenomenon have made it worse, and greater consumer throughput has put movies and television on the menu.  The Internet represents a user definable broadcast spectrum that makes the notion of a ""television network"" almost incoherent.  That is the actual issue obscured by this site going down or that service going under:  the ice age has arrived for massive conglomerates.  They can adapt to this shift, or they can become museum exhibits.  Up to them.

Implacably, The Last Christmas marches
on.  This is the eternal problem with giving the reins
of our work over to the sly forces of continuity:  events
will arise that seem to demand comment, but we're doing stuff.
Luckily, this is the odd scenario where what we're doing kind of
works.  If you want to conflate Electronic Arts and a monstrous,
unkillable behemoth engaged in a worldwide orgy of consumption, well,
the argument
is there.


Something else the annual We're Right awards does, just as purely
tertiary functionality, is give us an opportunity to catalogue the
year's releases in a way that can be referred to at some point in the
future.  That's probably a tradition worth maintaining.


Without equivocation or flourish, this year in gaming was the r0x0r.       


Indeed, the rocking was so complete that I didn't have time to play everything.  We had other projects, like Child's Play and the birth of a human being, but it is our job and indeed our passion to play everything that comes out and we were still unable to accomplish it.  I never got to play the sequel to Viewtiful Joe.  I never got to play Baten Kaitos, even though it is a card based game with cards that age and change while they sit in your inventory!  I honestly don't know what happened there.     


I've just now, in the past few days, had an opportunity to play Knights of the Old Republic II.  It's been excellent thus far.  Should it be on the top ten list?  I couldn't tell you.  I know that you can fall right through the world geometry.  But it seemed like if I was going to present you with a list of ten games, but I hadn't actually gotten my hands on a few of the big ones, I should let you know.  If those are some of your favorites, just put them in the list somehwere.  I'll never know, and you can be right.     


There's also games that were just outside the holy ten, camped on its wild edge.  These would be games like Katamari Damacy, which is excellent and unstoppable, but so defiant of traditional play that there's no standard location for it, it's so surreal and steeped in wonder that putting it in  with other games seems unnatural.  Anyway, it's just outside the top spots, but it's number one and also every other number (and letter) in its own ethereal continuum.  Mario Power Tennis is perfect, even without the many accoutrements, some of which add a lot of value ot the player.  It's on the edge as well.  Transformers for the PS2 isn't one of the year's best games, but it is the only game that lets you jump over a cliff and then transform in mid air and shoot a guy.  It seems like that should be recognized.  Sid Meier's Pirates is easily ""Number 11,"" pawing at the door and begging to be let in.  Because it is called Pirates, it's the sort of game that a well-meaning relative might get for their gamer nephew.  If it should appear under the tree, stand to your feet immediately and recognize that person.  They have done you a mighty favor.  


With a heavy heart, we are trudging toward Spokanistan today.  Updates will be delivered as per the usual schedule, as I desperately need something to keep my mind off that barren expanse.  If you've never been there, the things I say about it probably strike you as hyperbolic.  Let me assure you that I have been metered in my derision.  For example, I never spoke of the black idol that juts up from the lava at the corner of Francis and Division.  It draws all men with honeyed lies and binds them in eternal service.

476,2004-12-24,"The Last Christmas, Page Four","This season's presentation of The Last Christmas is nearing it's completion with this, the penultimate entry.


On our drive over to ""The Can,"" the brakes went out while we were going through the mountains, which transformed the rest of the trip into a demonic roller-coaster.  As I supped on true fear, it occurred to me that you would probably find this ordeal entertaining.  Do you see?  Even at death's door, your amusement is paramount.


It was difficult, and there were compromises, but these are the most important games that hit this year. 


10.  City of Heroes


I have a feeling that this situation wasn't unique to my own experience.  Absolutely every person I knew, even tangentially, was playing the game - creating a vortex which drew me in to a retail purchase practically against my will.  I had imagined that City of Heroes constituted a sort of seedy roadhouse en route to the year's other top-shelf MMOs, but the actuality was something quite different:  they had boiled the genre's conventions down to the bones, made unbelievably rich character creation the focus, and sped the pace of the game to an unprecedented degree.  It's a different kind of ""massively multiplayer"" experience, based as it is largely on instances where your group is the focus.  Cryptic's very real commitment to new content - which arrives in the form of story-rich ""chapters,"" with custom adventure for different levels - is just another way that they've done it right, virtually out of the gate.  I like to believe that their ability to buck the assumptions of that ""market"" means that even greater diversity in multi-user environments is not only possible, but sustainable.   


9.  Myst IV: Revelation


When I think back over the things we accomplished in this game, it's hard to imagine what thought processes led to those solutions.  That's the reason I keep coming back to this series:  transplanted to these unheard of realms, the mind is stretched by each elaborate knob that is presented.  One begins to make assumptions based on the properties unique to each world, those assumptions become a foundation, more elaborate projections are made, these are proven true or false, and before you know it you have a reasonable grasp of a truly alien physics and cosmology.  I enjoy the sensation.  Getting stuck saps your will.  You can spend a lot of time suffering as you dismantle firmly held preconceptions.  And when you succeed, oh, when you succeed, it is like leaping from a shard of raw diamond into a pool of liquid light.     


8.  Phantom Brave


Nippon Ichi makes a type of tactical puzzle game that you can play as long as you want to.  Disgaea and La Pucelle introduced us to their unique approach, which bears many similarities from game to game.  We playes Phantom Brave so much that it's difficult to think of it without warm affection.  The ownership one takes in their games, which emphasize and encourage this to a marvelous degree, is cemented with each new custom class you create, each new weapon and item you advance, each random dungeon you craft, and each new class you earn.  It's simply very satisfying to play, and when one saves they feel they have accomplished something enduring.  When most of one's life accomplishments are ethereal, that's a nice touch.     


I submit that holiday punch that has been spiked be referred to as Holiday Punch +1.  That is all.

The Last Christmas cycle is now complete.  I hope that you've enjoyed it, as it was a lot of fun to make, but I understand that those two states are not always correlated.  I consider the entire project a success, largely because I was able to rhyme something with gestate.


7.  Metroid Prime 2


Initially it was a kind of responsibility that put me to it, collecting the powerups I had amassed in other games bearing the Metroid title and charging my beams dutifully.  It seemed wrong somehow for those advanced technologies to be scattered around unused or the plaything of an oil-slick creature of shadow.  Before I knew it I was up all night, those missions were my own missions, my reconstituted arsenal boring caverns in an enemy carapace with unheard of energies.  The game is simply engrossing.  I relish any opportunity to hold the Wavebird for an extended period, and it's always distressed me that there are so few opportunities.  I suppose I could sit and hold it in the dark, but that's hardly the kind of experience I'm talking about.     


6.  Shadow Hearts


Gabriel, whose enthusiasm for Shadow Hearts causes him to deliver passionate oratories, could probably explain to you better why he thinks Shadow Hearts should be here - but I think I can paraphrase him.  The highly customizable Judgement Ring, a conceit that makes every strike in the game an affair of arcade precise timing, brings an immediacy to a turn-based system that he's found himself missing in other, higher rated RPGs.  Moreover, the game is funny, with its original homosexual-tailor-based advancement system and other subversions of genre staples.  It is a parody of the overwrought narrative which is utterly universal in Japanese role-playing games.  Indeed, it is an antidote. 


5.  Ninja Gaiden


When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case.  In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies.  Just before Team Ninja released their first content drop, I fished it back out and found that I couldn't stop playing it.  The reason for this is that it is one of the best action games in years, with meaty conflicts that look almost choreographed manifesting a combat system that is clearly the result of exhaustive, iterated design and testing. It is not an accident if you succeed in Ninja Gaiden - it's the result of your internalizing the lessons.  It will digest you if you aren't ready for it.  It's rare that a game is difficult without feeling cheap, and in Ninja Gaiden for the most part I have to offer up a grudging respect.

478,2004-12-28,Brothers In Arms,"
We had the opportunity to do something really interesting with our most recent Penny Arcade Presents project. We actually got to sit down with the guys over at Gearbox and come up with something that tied in with the game in a really cool way. One of the characters you’ll meet in the game is a guy by the name of Johnny Rivas. You’ll find out when you play BIA that he’s actually an artist and he keeps a sketchbook/ journal with him all the time. What we did is actually create that sketchbook and you can get a copy of it if you order the bonus edition. It’s eight pages and contains journal entries as well as sketches all done from the point of view of Johnny Rivas. Some of the entries cover events you’ll see in the game and others give you insights into events that occur outside your game experience. 




Anyway, we’re super proud of it and it’s exciting for us that it’s actually being printed and given out alongside the game. I really want to thank Gearbox for letting us create something that fits in so tightly with their game.

God dammit, we couldn't resist capping that Sony Syndrome thing we had going - so here you go.  After such a deep excursion into continuity, one hopes that we will finally be free of its debilitating effects. 


Now I remember another reason why we might devote the end of the year to retrospectives:  because there's nothing fucking happening, games-wise.  I'd begun to think the We're Right thing was borne almost entirely of laziness.  It turns out that it's almost indestructibly pragmatic. 


4.  Half-Life 2


Half-Life 2, like the original, makes an important choice - the kind of choice that is so high level that many other decisions are automatic.  It is a first person shooter that takes the term seriously, never pulling the camera from your own perspective even when doing so would be expedient or aid exposition.  The end result is that the things that are happening in the game are happening to you, you personally.  It's the difference between being an action hero and playing an action hero on television - in the second of these two scenarios, you are heroic only by proxy.  Half-Life 2, as good as it was, is only part of the reason the game claims the number four slot.  I have extremely high hopes for Source and Steam as forces for good.  The community produced games I liked best from the last year - Alien Swarm, Clone Bandits, and AirBuccaneers - are all based on Unreal technology.  I'll be curious to see what engine attracts the best talent next year. 




3.  Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow


The single-player portion of the experience was noteworthy, what with its highly cinematic setpieces and extrapolated political fiction.  Even without it, the multiplayer - sometimes referred to as Adversarial Mode - would be here at number three all by its lonesome.  Gabriel was in nightly for months, and it wasn't until we started hitting cons in the summer that he was broken of the habit.  I know of no other game, online or off, that seizes the player with such extremes of joy and sorrow.  The two experiences that comprise it are each unlike any other game, and the notion that they could be thrown against each other in competition is audacious.  It's one of the most truly original multiplayer games in years, in a space where major innovations typically revolve around how many flags there are, and what precisely one must do with the flags once they have been obtained.


2.  Burnout 3: Takedown


Burnout 3 is damned near the perfect videogame.  As I said at the time, it's a ""driving game"" only because cars, speed, and roads are perfect metaphors for a high-speed platforming experience that, by its third iteration, is so refined that to play it is to utterly dissolve your capacity to resist it.  Just as Pandora Tomorrow would have made it here without its accomplished solo campaign, Burnout 3 is a game so complete, original, and enthralling that the addition of multiplayer is almost ridiculous in its generosity.  It expands the capacity of the human heart.  You'll forget it even has it, and seeing it in the menu you will feel a thrill like finding money.

480,2004-12-31,A Being Of Indescribable Power,"
It was idle speculation when, a couple years ago, I held forth airily
about some future game that could enthrall so absolutely that
it would obviate all other expressions of the form.  It's the sort of
topic one posits when one has no pressing concerns and is interested
primarily in a lengthy discussion.  Certainly, no electronic
experience could never be universally applied - there is a natural
variance in human predilections.  That's just me covering all the bases, though.  I have confidence that the game I'm about to suggest has the power to grip you.   


1.  World Of Warcraft


We've even done a comic
about it today, which depicts the marital strife that can be generated
by level disparities.  


But World of Warcraft is so rich that there are almost an unlimited number of things to fight with your wife about.  You could get into a fracas about the three development paths for each class.  Your eyes could flash with anger while discussing the prices your partner charges at the auction house.  You could seethe for months over that single raid encounter that went terribly, terribly wrong.       


It's called World of Warcraft, but the addiction profile is really more along the lines of Diablo.  Except that Diablo never had thousands of quests you could take in a world full of people also taking those quests, nor did every character have several professions that can create useful items out of game resources.  You could certainly create guilds, they were largely social constructs and it's nothing like the 150 person extravaganza I'm in now.  You certainly had powers in Diablo, but even at my current level I have so many abilities a single bar isn't sufficient.  Indeed, I even have the three extra bars you get with Cosmos filled up with items that I use every play session.  Every one of these buttons does something critical and I couldn't be without any of them.  So envision a Diablo with every empty space filled with delicious bavarian creams.


I could write the entire post purely about how potent their aesthetic is, how each place you go is firmly distinguished from every other place, but I have a feeling this information is already well known.  I could even pine for the forthcoming PVP Battlegrounds, which I imagine is less common knowledge.  But sitting here writing about the game is only increasing my appetite for it, spinning and connecting what I know about the world into a cohesive character lineage.  The fact of the matter is that World of Warcraft is essentially the apex of the genre, and even those who are not proponents of Massive games should try it.   


When we were in Spokane, I constantly sang a song I had written about crocolisks to get me through the withdrawals.  So I've got it bad.     


It never really occurred to me what would happen to Penny Arcade if I
stopped playing ""games"" in a general sense and instead focused my adult
life entirely on swelling with holy power in one of them.  I guess we'll find out.
